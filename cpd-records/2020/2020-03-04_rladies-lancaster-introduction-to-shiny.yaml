  I ran a beginner friendly Shiny tutorial for R-Ladies Lancaster. I wrote a practical for participants.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Preparing for this workshop made me revisit what it's like to learn shiny as a beginner. 
  I thought about how to explain the different components, and how they all interact.
benefit_to_users: |
  I regularly have to explain to clients what a shiny app is and how it works.
  This session helped me practice explaining these complex topics in understandable terms.
