activity_description: |
  This session was run by an external company to teach Jumping Rivers how to use Kubernetes - a tool for managing virtual machines when deploying complex models.
benefit_to_practice: |
  This was a 4 hour session, however it was poorly pitched and delivered. I left with only a slightly better understanding of kubernetes then I already had.
  However, I did get a lot from reviewing the company's approach to online training and comparing this with our own approach.
  It was beneficial to participate in online training as an attendee rather than the presenter. It highlighted to me the importance of structure, setting expectations and regular breaks.
benefit_to_users: |
  I learnt more about the basics of kubernetes so I could now confidently discuss requirements with clients. On a broader level, I also revisited our own online training sessions after this and made changes which should help make the sessions more engaging.
