  As part of the RSS 2020 Conference, I took part in a panel session about Statistical 
  Consultancy. Preparing for this talk made me reflect on my experiences as a statistical consultant and
  consider my strengths and weaknesses. I also learnt a lot from listening to the other panelists.

  As part of my reflection I identified a time where things went wrong. A  lack of communication with the client
  led to a misunderstanding, which left the client feeling unheard and ignored. I then reflected on how I
  can best communicate with clients in future. I believe the key to this is setting clear expectations at the start.

  In future, I'll be clearer with the way I communicate with clients. I'll set expectations clearly at the start
  about communication as well as delivery. This should help my clients feel confident in my ability to deliver on time.
