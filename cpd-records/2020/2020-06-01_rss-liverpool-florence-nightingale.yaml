activity_description: |
  I was invited to present at an RSS local group talk on Data Viz and Florence Nightingale.
  As part of my preparation, I researched a lot about data visualisation techniques, and in particular polar area charts.
benefit_to_practice: |
  During the development of my talk, I learnt how to create polar area diagrams in R.
  I also learnt how to use the flipbookR package. This allows users to build a visualisation in stages.
benefit_to_users: |
  Now that I know how to create flipbook animations,
  I'll use them in teaching scenarios to help learners understand the different components
  of ggplot visualisations.
