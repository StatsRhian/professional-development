activity_description: |
  The {broom} R package is used to manipulate the output of statistical tests in R.
  I learned how to pull out statistical parameters such as the AIC and BIC.
  I also learned how to calculate the model residuals and compare them to the original data set.
benefit_to_practice: |
  The {broom} package is very helpful for quickly comparing the output of statistical models.
  Understanding how this package works will help me create useful diagnostic plots and analyse model fit.
benefit_to_users: |
  This package helps users interpret model output in a more user-friendly way.
  I can know better support users in working with the standardised residuals of their models.
  This is also part of the curriculum on our Statistical Modelling course.
