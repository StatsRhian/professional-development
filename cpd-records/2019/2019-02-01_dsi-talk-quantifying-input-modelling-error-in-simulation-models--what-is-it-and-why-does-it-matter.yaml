activity_description: | 
  Lucy Morgan, a new lecturer in the Management School, gave a
  very interesting talk on simulation models. Lucy discussed how assessing inputs
  into a simulation model is an area often overlooked, both in terms of the uncertainty
  and biases that inputs have on model outputs. Lucy showed how these effects can
  be properly quantified and interpreted.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Input error is an important but often neglected area of simulation
  modelling. Learning about what input error is and how I can best model it will be
  key to any future simulation modelling that I perform.
benefit_to_users: |
  Any clients requiring simulation modelling will be reassured that I have thought about the possibility of input error, and have taken steps to quantify
  their effects on the model output.
