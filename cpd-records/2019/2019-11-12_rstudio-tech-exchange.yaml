activity_description: | 
  In 2019, I attended three of the RStudio technical exchange meetings.
  In these sessions, staff at RStudio introduce new developments coming to the RStudio ecosystem.
  Discussions have included reticulate, installing binary R packages with RStudio Package Manager and how to pin data on RStudio Connect.
benefit_to_practice: |
  The technical exchange keeps me up-to-date with new developments in the RStudio ecosystem.
  I've learned how to use pins to pin data on RStudio connect, and the new developments to the {plumber} package for developing APIs.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients use RStudio products daily.
  Having a good understanding of their features, and the upcoming developments allows me to support my clients needs.
  This session also allows me to feedback any feature requests from our clients directly to RStudio.
