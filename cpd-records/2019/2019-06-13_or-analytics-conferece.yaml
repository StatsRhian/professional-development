activity_description: |
  The annual one-day Analytics Summit organised by the OR Society.
  I attended talks and ran an exhibit.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Payal Jain gave an interesting talk defining the building blocks for an effective data analytics function.
  She highlighted the importance of focusing on people rather than data, which made me reflect on my own approach to large scale data science projects.
benefit_to_users: |
  The OR community contains a number of clients who are keen to migrate from other software and learn R & Python. 
  By engaging with this community and learning about the challenges in the industry, I can better support my clients needs.
