  Vicki Hanson spoke on the ACMâ€™s Data Science initiatives at the DSI morning talks.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Vicki talked mostly about the challenges when setting up a Data
  Science masters programme from the perspective of a computer scientist. 
  This encouraged me to reflect on my own data science learning journey, one pre-dominantly from the
  statistics side. It also made me consider the best way to teach these concepts when
  time is short.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Thinking about the best way to teach data science will structure and inform the way that I teach both statistics and programming in my training courses.
