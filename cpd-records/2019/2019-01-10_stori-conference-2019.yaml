activity_description: | 
  The Annual STOR-i conference held at Lancaster University. 
  Approximately 100 attendees across academia and industry, mostly focused on cutting edge research in statistical and operations research.
  I attended a key-note and the poster session.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Even though I am now in industry, I believe it is important to stay up-to-date with the statistics literature.
  By attending this conference, I am able to keep up to date with the latest developments in change point analysis,
  extreme value theory, multi-armed bandits and cluster analysis.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Users can be assured that I keep up-to-date with the latest developments in statistics, and am well-versed in a number of statistical areas.
