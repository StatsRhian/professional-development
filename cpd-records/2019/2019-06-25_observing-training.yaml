activity_description: | 
  I observed my colleague Theo deliver training for two days at Santander. 
  The courses were Introduction to R and Programming with R.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In my new position, I'll need to deliver training courses.
  Observing Theo, I got to witness his delivery style, become more familiar with our training materials and understand the flow of an on-site training course.
  I also taught one chapter of the course which was great for my confidence.
benefit_to_users: |
  Observing others deliver training, and learning the teaching material will help me deliver excellent quality training courses to our clients.
