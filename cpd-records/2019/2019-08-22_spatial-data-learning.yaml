activity_description: |
  In work I had to write material for a new course on Spatial Data Analysis. 
  This involved a lot of research into the best ways to handle spatial data in R.
  I used a number of resources, but my main focus was reading the Geocomputation with R book.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Whilst writing this course I learnt about a number of R packages for handling spatial data, in particular {sf}, {tmap} and {leaflet}.
  I also learnt about the different ways of coding spatial data (vector vs raster) and how to use co-ordinate reference systems.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients with to build maps to visualise spatial data. 
  I now have a good understand of creating both static and interactive maps in R. 
  I've also got good knowledge around how spatial vector data is handled in R, and how to troubleshoot common problems.
