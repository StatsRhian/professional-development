activity_description: | 
  I needed to learn the {purrr} R package for work, both for client projects and teaching.
  I worked through Chapters 21 and 25 of the R4DS book.
benefit_to_practice: |
  The {purrr} package is a key part of the tidyverse and allows users to quickly write iterative code.
  Learning {purrr} will allow me to quickly write iterative code, in the new tidyverse framework.
  It's also a package that I'll need to teach in one of our training courses.
benefit_to_users: |
  Being able to use {purrr} will allow me to re-write slow for loops in a more efficient, tidyverse framework on client projects.
  I can also write code to help users complete common challenges, such as combining similar datasets.
