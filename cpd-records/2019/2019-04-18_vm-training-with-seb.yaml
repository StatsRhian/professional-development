  Training on how to set up and host a Virtual Machine for training  courses.
benefit_to_practice: |
  As part of my role at JR, I'll be supporting Seb with some of the infrastructure for our training courses.
  Seb explained the full process of developing VMs which includes building a virtual machine, setting a DNS, adding SSL certificates and installing dependencies onto the machine.
benefit_to_users: |
  Stable VMs are essential for a smooth training experience during courses.
  It also means I can have the technical skills to fix any issues that may occur during training.
  Finally, I'll be able to discuss deployment elements with consultancy clients in a more technical manner.
