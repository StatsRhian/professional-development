activity_description: |
  I presented a talk to a group of school children on Randomness and Probabilities.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Writing this talk made me think about the best way to explain complex concepts such as randomness to 16 year old girls.
  There were also a number of excellent talks which gave me inspirations for other styles of teaching I could adopt.
benefit_to_users: | 
  As a professional female mathematician I think it's important to demonstrate to young girls what sort of career paths are possible for them. 
  I would hope that users of my service this see that as a worthwhile development, giving back to the STEM community.
  Finally it demonstrates to my clients that I am able to convey complex statistical concepts in an understandable, digestible way.
