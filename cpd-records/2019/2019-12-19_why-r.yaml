activity_description: |
  I shadowed Colin Gillespie delivering a Why R course.
  This is a course for managers explaining the positives and challenges when bringing R into their teams.
benefit_to_practice: |
  This is a course I need to deliver next year, so it was great to observe Colin's training style.
  It gave me ideas of how to communicate and connect with managers and it highlighted the concerns
  that managers often have about adopting a programming language into their analytics teams.
benefit_to_users: |
  Managers often have concerns when adopting a new product into their team.
  Being able to provide an informative WhyR session will help them be able to make an informed decision about this choice.
