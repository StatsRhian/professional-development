activity_description: |
  David Elliott gave a fascinating talk on Seizure Detection with Machine Learning.
  Ryan Callihan gave an excellent overview of Natural Language Processing.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I found it really useful to hear Ryan discuss the different methods he uses in NLP and particularly the different libraries that are used in Python.
  It was also an excellent way to meet other data practitioners in Lancaster.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients work with text data. I now have a better understanding of the different models available and how they should be applied.
