activity_description: |
  As part of my role supporting Seb and the data engineering team, I took the RStudio Team system administration course.
  I learned how to administer RStudio products such as Server Pro, Connect and Package Manager.
benefit_to_practice: |
  It was really useful for me to learn how these products which I use daily are administered.
  I learned more about authentication methods such as LDAP and security best practices.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients use the RStudio Team products.
  Having a better understanding of the infrastructure behind these products and the different license options will enable me to support clients using these tools.
