activity_description: | 
  I attended the annual RSS conference, this year held in Belfast.
  The panel discussion "stats the way to write it" was a fascinating discuss of how to best write a book on a statistical topic. 
  I also particularly enjoyed the session "Show me the stats" which focussed on visualisation. This included talks from Allan Reese and Robert Cuffe(BBC).
  Finally, "Fighting fake news and false facts with evidence and statistical thinking" was a great discussion about the challenges of communicating statistics in the media.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  The annual RSS conference is an excellent opportunity for me to learn about new statistical techniques across various fields.
  It also helps me develop my teaching and communication skills, and is an excellent networking event.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Improving my statistical communication skills will help me better work with clients on technical projects. 
  Also, keeping up-to-date with the newest statistical techniques will widen the tools I'm able to apply in consultancy.
