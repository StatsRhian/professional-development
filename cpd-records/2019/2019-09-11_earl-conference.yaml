activity_description: |
  Annual conference on the Enterprise Applications of the R Language, hosted by Mango. 
  I was exhibiting a stall and attended a number of talks. 
  The talks I found most useful were Julia Silge discussing the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and Kelly Oâ€™ Briant covering how CI/CD tools can enhance reproducibility for R and data science.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Kelly's talk discussed best practices around getting data science projects into production. 
  I learned about strategies such as green-blue deployment and methods for continuous deployment.
  It was also an excellent networking opportunity.
benefit_to_users: |
  Having a good understanding of the best practices and possible pitfalls when deploying data science projects is key to ensuring a successful production pipeline for clients.
