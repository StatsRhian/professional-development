activity_description: |
  Self-taught research to learn the {recipes} and {parsnip} packages which make up the tidymodels framework in R.
  I read vignettes, blog posts and worked through practicals. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had used the {caret} package previously but did not know the new tidymodels framework.
  I'll need to teach these packages at Jumping Rivers, so I need to be very comfortable using these packages.
benefit_to_users: |
  Our clients are often interested in learning how to implement machine learning models in R.
  This framework allows them to compare different models in a comparable space. 
  I'll also be able to help our users convert over from the older package {caret} to the new framework {parsnip}.
