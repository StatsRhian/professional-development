activity_description: | 
  I delivered a talk on Continuous Integration. 
  Chris Campbell gave a talk on R for Primary Teaching
  Phrances Ayvee Perez talked about reactive function in {shiny} and tips for best practise
benefit_to_practice: | 
  It was brilliant to hear Chris talk about how R and {shiny} could be used to help KS1 children learn mathematics.
  His creative {shiny} apps have given me ideas about how we could be more creative in the way we teach.
  I also had some useful networking discussions on the CI/CD approach I talked about.
benefit_to_users: | 
  By constantly reflecting on how we use technology to teach statistical principles, it allows me to be more creative with my teaching and hopefully deliver high quality training sessions.
