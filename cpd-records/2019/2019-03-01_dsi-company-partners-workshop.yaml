activity_description: | 
  An afternoon of talks and activities focusing on the future of Applied Data Science.
  Talk topics varied from explaining existing and solved problems in industry, to incorporating data science into future projects.
  There was a workshop activity called "Building and Implementing Data Science Solutions" where we were given a data science problem
  and had to build the right resources in terms of both skilled workers and infrastructure.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I found the workshop activity very enlightening and enjoyable. 
  The process of building a team that could provide a suitable level of support was challenging and informative.
  This made me reflect on which projects require highly skilled statisticians vs junior data scientists and the importance of a good project manager.
  The talks introduced me a broad range of statistical challenges in industry.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Being able to select the best tools for the job in terms of both human resources and infrastructure is key to running a successful consultancy project.
