activity_description: |
  I delivered a workshop on {ggplot2} at the two-day NHS R conference held in Birmingham. 
  I also attended a number of interesting talks including one on Shiny by Nic Crane and one on Why R by Steph Locke.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I learnt some good tips and tricks for Shiny development from Nic's talk.
  I also heard first hand the challenges that NHS analysts meet when trying to develop using R.
  For example, no access to modern packages, no way to deploy shiny apps, I.T infrastructure issues.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of my clients work in the public health sector.
  Having a good understanding of the challenges they face daily help me empathise with them, and offer appropriate solutions.
