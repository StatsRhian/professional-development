activity_description: | 
  A project for client meant I had to learn more about the R package
  kableExtra. I read the package vignettes, investigated the issue in the package and spent time testing the different options available.
benefit_to_practice: |
  There are many ways to display tables in R Markdown documents, but one of the most popular is {kableExtra}.
  Having a deep understanding of all the possible styling options, allows me to branded, complex tables in both HTML and PDF.
benefit_to_users: |
  I'm able to support users with technical questions related to formatting of both HTML and PDF tables using {kableExtra}.
  I'll be able to help clients meet specific table styling requirements programmatically.
