activity_description: |
  I'm on a two year leadership programme with Vistage. The second year included topics on service management, managing change and emotional intelligence.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I found the emotional intelligence session hugely enlightning. I am not more aware of my strengths, and I check in to make sure I am utilising them wisely.
benefit_to_users: |
  I'm also more aware of when my strengths can get in my way, and look out for signs that I might be communicating poorly, letting my overachieving get in the way or being too commanding.
