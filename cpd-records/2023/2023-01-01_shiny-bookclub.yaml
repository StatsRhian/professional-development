activity_description: |
  Russ organised an internal bookclub in work for Shiny. We talked about SASS, shinytest2 and did a review of a shiny application.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Building efficient, robust, professional shiny applications is a key part of my work at Jumping Rivers. Russ taught me some tools which will be very useful in future projects.
benefit_to_users: |
  We also discussed and critqued user interfaces for shiny applications which is a key aspect for our end users.
