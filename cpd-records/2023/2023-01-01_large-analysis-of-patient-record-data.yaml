activity_description: |
  I was involved in a very large project analysing patient records for a specific disease. I had to learn more about the specific disease, and the appropriate analysis techniques.
  I also had to design a workflow that would allow our German analyst to run the analysis seperately and then allow use to recombine the data at a later date. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  This was a complex project and I learned a lot about how to handle a large codebase which deals with sensitive data. 
benefit_to_users: |
  The experience gained in this project has directly influenced the way I approach new programmatic statistical analysis projects.
