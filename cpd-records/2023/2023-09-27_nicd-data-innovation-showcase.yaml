activity_description: |
  I gave a talk introducting Quarto to a non technical audience. I created an example based on healthcare. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  There were some great introductory talks on statistical methods, version control and data science pipelines. 
  I reflected on how I could better introduce those topics when I'm talking with non-technical audiences.
benefit_to_users: |
  Being able to explain the benefits of data science workflows and techniques to non-technical people is a key part of my work as a consultant.
