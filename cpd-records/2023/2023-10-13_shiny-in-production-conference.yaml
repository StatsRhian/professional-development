activity_description: |
  A very niche, but relevant conference for me. I learned so much from Cara's keynote on plot styling.
  Anna's talk on "Why users don't use your app" was another useful one. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  As a Shiny expert, it's important for me to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in shiny.
benefit_to_users: |
  This gave me a few ideas for technical approaches to shiny applciations, but more importantly UI/UX elements which I will bring into future projects.
