activity_description: |
  I work with many people who are neurodiverse and so I wanted to learn a little more about Autism.
  I want to make sure that I an inclusive, and that as a leader and educator, I create a welcoming environment.
  This was an 8 week course, which I studied in my own time over a couple of months.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I didn't know much about Autism before starting this course.
  By the end, I had learned more about history of Autism, the variety of the spectrum and had a greater awareness of some way I could support neurodiverse people.
benefit_to_users: |
  This course has helped me understand the different needs of autistic people, which has lead to me being more considerate when designing courses and working practices.
