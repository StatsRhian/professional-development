activity_description: |
  I attended a couple of NEDS, Databrick and Lead Dev meetups in 2023. Databricks is totally new to me, and I found it really useful to attend some introductory workshops.
  The Lead Dev panel on Burnout in tech was really useful in helping me support my team and also led to me recognising that I was burnt out myself.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Recognising the symptoms in the burnout session helped me take the time I needed to start recovering and get help.
benefit_to_users: |
  Databricks is a tool that clients often ask for help with. I now feel more confident getting started and helping them decide if it's useful for their needs.
