activity_description: |
  I get Signficance magazine as part of my RSS membership. I find that the short, pop-science style articles are a great way for me to keep my statistical knowledge fresh.
benefit_to_practice: |
  As I do more programming at the moment, I sometimes worry that my general statistical knowledge will get rusty.
  These articles are perfectly pitched to remind me of key modelling approaches.
benefit_to_users: |
  Having a broad range of statistical tools means I'm more likely to suggest a suitable model for my clients.
