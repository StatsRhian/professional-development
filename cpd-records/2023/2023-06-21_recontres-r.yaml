activity_description: |
  R conference for French speakers. I was an invited keynote. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  Some interesting talks here, in particular the one from Aur√©lie on importer syndrome.
  Attending a conference in a different language gave me a new perspective on how to make content inclusive for people who are less comfortable in the language of the conference.
benefit_to_users: |
  There were a number of talks on reproducibility. A number of my clients work in government and are keen to create more "RAP" workflows.
