activity_description: Matt Barnes talked about data science methods used to analyse air quality data. 
benefit_to_practice: Matt gave an excellent talk about analysing air quality data.
  He highlighted a number of specific challenges with collecting air quality data
  which had not occurred to me before. We also had an in depth chat about using API's.
  Since this talk I've been enthused to investigate Open APIs and see whether these
  can be utilised in the systems that we are developing.
benefit_to_users: I am currently investigating methods to integrate open source weather
  (particularly API systems) with our client data where required to create deeper,
  more improved systems.
