activity_description: The Data Science Radar as a conceptual framework that allows
  users to explore these character traits in more detail and to uncover their own
  data science profile type. I scored as follows, Programmer (6.2), Modeller (5.4), Communicator (4.3), Data Wrangler (4.1), Visualiser (3.8), Technologist (3.4)
benefit_to_practice: I have a tendancy to try and be good at everything rather than
  specialising in specific skills. Looking at my radar has reminded me of the skills
  which are less important in the roles that I do. I think I should focus on maintaining
  my Modelling, Programming and Communication skills rather than trying to keep on
  top of all the new different technologies (Docker, Hadoop etc.)
benefit_to_users: By identifying the areas in which I should focus my development, I can tailor my long-term data science development to best support my existing skills and my clients needs.
