activity_description: For 6 weeks, I privately tutored two students, one GCSE student
  and one A-Level student.
benefit_to_practice: Revisiting the material for GCSE and A-Level was a great way
  for me to re-connect with basic mathematical principles. Having to explain these
  concepts to teenagers helped me rethink the way that I communicate, using many
  examples.cAlso, having to structure the lessons and set homework encouraged me to
  reflect on planning.
benefit_to_users: Being able to succinctly explain mathematical concepts to lay-people
  will greatly improve my ability to engage with clients.
