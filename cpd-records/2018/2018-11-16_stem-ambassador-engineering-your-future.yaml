  I volunteered at Engineering Your Future Career Awareness Days, one at Siemends and one at MMU. At each session their were 100 16-18 year old students all studying STEM subjects. I worked on the career stall and engaged with students about the different pathways that engineering could take them.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I learnt how to build a quick and simple object detection algorithm which was useful as we are intending to build or own bespoke object detection algorithm. I also practised my engagement skills, chatting with 16-year-olds about pursuing a career in engineering.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Being able to explain our work to non-technical users is important for engaging with clients. It's also important to show our users that we meet Corporate Social Responsible and give back to the future STEM students.
