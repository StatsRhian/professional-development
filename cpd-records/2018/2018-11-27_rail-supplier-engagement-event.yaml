benefit_to_practice: |
  Martin Little from the Rail Alliance gave a thorough introduction to the rail industry. He explained TOCS, ROCS and government agencies. He also gave 15 tips for getting started working in the rail industry. This overview really helped me understand how the many different rail companies interact.
benefit_to_users: |
  A detailed understanding of the interaction between companies is vital to ensuring that we are working in the correct space and all the appropriate partners. I also spoke to Rail Alliance about how we can get testing vouchers to test our products. By testing our products on a real train we can improve the quality and highlight any potential issues early.
