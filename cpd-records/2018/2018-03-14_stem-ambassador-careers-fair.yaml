activity_description: Careers event for Years 9-11. I volunteered to give a 20 minutes
  presentation about my career.
benefit_to_practice: As part of delivering this talk, I had to work on my communication
  skills. I decided to present without slides, and therefore it was critical to ensure
  I was able to communicate the pathway that statistics can take you clearly to the
  students.I also believe that it is greatly important to give back to the STEM community,
  and particular engaging with young STEM students.
benefit_to_users: Better communication skills, and it's good to give back.
