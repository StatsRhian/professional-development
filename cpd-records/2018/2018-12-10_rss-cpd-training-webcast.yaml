activity_description: |
  I independently worked through CPD training on the RSS YouTube channel.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Although I have already attended an RSS CPD course, I found it very useful to revisit this webcast. This time I focussed more on the planning and general development rather than the actual activities.
benefit_to_users: |
  Since working through this I have decided to make a development plan in order to ensure that my CPD matched the skills that I need to develop.
