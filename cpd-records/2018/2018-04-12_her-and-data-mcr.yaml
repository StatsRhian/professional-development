activity_description: Their were talks from Silvia Maggi (computational neuroscientist), Rebecca Davey (data scientist at INRIX) and Clara Higuera Cabanes &  Magda Piatkowska from the BBC.
benefit_to_practice: Reconnecting with Magda and Clara was great. Their talk about
  clustering, really got me thinking about using data to personalise services. Rebecca's
  talk was particularly relevant as it was in the transport industry. Silvia's talk
  drew some fascinating similarities between neural networks and the brain.
benefit_to_users: These talks gave me encouraged me to start working with neural networks,
  a new technique which we can incorporate in our work.
