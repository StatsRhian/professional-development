activity_description: Using a real-life data set R-Ladies Manchester hosted a workshop evening allowing members and develop for data science. This session focused on using
  branches in GitHub to work on different versions of the project &  Importing data
  into R.
benefit_to_practice: The introduction to using branches in GitHub was very insightful.
  I also taught some data analysis techniques to other attendees.

  documented, uses version control and is reproducible.
