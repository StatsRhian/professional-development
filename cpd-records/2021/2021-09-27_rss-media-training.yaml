  Training for the RSS statisticial ambassadors.
  Part one was focused on the "How" of communicating, and part two focused on the "What?"
benefit_to_practice: |
  From part one, I realised that I use my hands a lot and so should "set the shot" to include my hands. 
  Good reminders to say technical words (and my name!) slowly. Remember they are new words for the listener. 
  PAUSE. Use full stops. It makes you seem more credible.
  From part two, the main take away was to come up with a 15 second snippet, do the research, and strong start/finish.
  Again with the pauses - make the interviewer do the work.
benefit_to_users: |
  Being able to communicate clearly is a huge part of my job, from client work, to delivering online courses.
