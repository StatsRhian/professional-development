  WhyR online one-day conference.
  I watched half of the sessions and helped deliver a session on RStudio Connect.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Andrew's talk on R in Production gave me a good overview to having reliable, maintainable infrastructure
  to support statistical models.
  Anna's talk on How to be a Shiny developer helped me reflect on the skills that need to be developed in our teams at JR.
benefit_to_users: |
  When we deliver a statistical model to a client, we don't just handover the model, but also a way to interact with that model.
  This usually involves providing some sort of infrastructure. It's important for this to be reliable and easy to maintain.
