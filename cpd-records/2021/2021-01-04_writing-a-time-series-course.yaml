activity_description: |
  I wrote the material for a one-day time series course. 
  In order to do this, I did a large amount of research both into statistical models for time series, and their implementation in R.
  I read the book Forecasting: Principles and Practice, which helped me learn more about the R packages {fable}, {feasts} and {tsibble}.
  I also refreshed my knowledge on Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA models.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Having a refreshed knowledge of important time series models such as ETS and ARIMA will help me work on projects which require forecasting.
  I've become more confident using the {tidyverts} ecosystem, in particular visualising time series data with {feasts}.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients work with time series data. Having a good understanding of both the statistical methods and the implementation in R will allow me to meet their needs.
