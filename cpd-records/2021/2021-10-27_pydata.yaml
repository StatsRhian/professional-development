activity_description: |
 I attended two PyData meetups in 2021. October had talks by Rebecca Killick and Simon Spavound.
 November was  Naomi Lourie and Charlotte Smith. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  Rebecca's talk on R packages made me consider how to build packages which are simple to maintain. 
  Naomi spoke about her first data science project. This helped me reflect as a manager on what projects I can get my
  people working on, and to encourage them to share their experience of it early.
benefit_to_users: |
  PyData meetups allow me to stay well connected to both the latest approaches in data science, and networking connections across the North West.
