activity_description: |
  This conference was organised by my work and brought together many technical experts. 
  Highlights included, Colin Fay's destroy all widgets which focused on the userbility of applications, and Caterina's summary of web app tools. 
  Mike's talk {pins} was also very informative.  
benefit_to_practice: |
  As a Shiny expert, it's important for me to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in shiny.
benefit_to_users: |
  This gave me a few ideas for technical approaches to shiny applciations, but more importantly UI/UX elements which I will bring into future projects.
