activity_description: |
  I'm on a two year leadership programme with Vistage. The first year included topics on finance, performance management and delegation.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Thinking about delegation, lead me to reconsider what aspects are within my control and what are not. 
  I realised that I can be guilty of both doing work for those junior to me, but also trying to do the thinking of those more senior to me (and feeling frustated).
  I've started applying more focus to my efforts, utilising my skills and thought leadership at the level in which I can have the most impact.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a manager of a small team, the skills I learned in the performance management and delegation have helped me ensure that my reports have automony and purpose.
  I also have taken the financial planning ideas into my project budget.
