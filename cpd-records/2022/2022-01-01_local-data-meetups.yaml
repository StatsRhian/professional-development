activity_description: |
  I attended a number of R-Ladies and PyData Lancaster meetups. I also presented at an R-Ladies/Py-Ladies cross-over event.
  Topics varied, but included "my first data science project" and "Introduction to ML Ops"
benefit_to_practice: |
  These meetups often have broad topics, and it opens me up to new areas I might not have considered.
  I also believe it's important to support local meetups, and it's a great way to make connections.
benefit_to_users: |
  New tools and tips ensure that the work I deliver to clients is using the latest best practice.
