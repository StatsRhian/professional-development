activity_description: |
  ITS analysis was required for a project at work. I had not done this before.
  Effectively it involves looking at statistical properties of time series before and after an "interruption".
  I researched about the approach, in particular the assumptions about sample size.
benefit_to_practice: |
  ITS is another analysis in my toolbox that I can use. 
benefit_to_users: |
  ITS is often used in official statistics analysis. It's also quite simple to understand and interpret.
