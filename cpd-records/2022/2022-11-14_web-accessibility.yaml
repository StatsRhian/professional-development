activity_description: |
  I developed an app for a client and they wanted me to ensure the app met WGAC 2.1 standard.
  I learned about the standards, and how to implement things like skip links in Shiny applications. 
  I also learned the importance of correct header ordering. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  I was aware of some basics around web accessibility, but this project forced me to delve deeper into the details of the standard. 
  I also learned some tools which can help me check my apps in future e.g. Lighthouse
benefit_to_users: |
  As a developer of user tools, it's important I build tools which are accessible for all.
