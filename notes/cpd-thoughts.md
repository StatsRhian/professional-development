CPD should be a key part of a professional statistician's work ethic.

CPD means the development of the "whole person" statistical and non-statistical, technical
and personal.

CPD evaluation is essentially a self-assessment process.

CPD is defined in four broad categories, for which the Society will provide detailed specifications: 1. Learning. 2. Doing. 3. Managing. 4. Other.

How the activity has helped develop skills and knowledge to improve professional practice; and also how the activity has improved the delivery of services to your employer or client. 



It is important that the description of activities presented in a CPD summary is sufficiently detailed to enable a reviewer to fully understand the nature of the activity and be able to appreciate its relevance to the current job role or to future career aspirations

avoid or explain acronyms

 ensure that activities are sufficiently granular to enable a specific description to be given. For example, ‘carrying out research’ is too nebulous a description and such an activity needs to be broken down into its components, each of which may have a different outcome or benefit. For example, the above example may be broken down into the following activities; ‘carrying out a literature review of xyz’, ‘networking with collaborators on xyz’, ‘developing methodology to analyse data arising from situation xyz’ and/or ‘preparing a publication entitled xyz for journal abc’.
