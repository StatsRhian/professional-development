activity_description: |
  I attended the virtual EdinbR meetup to hear Eric Nantz talk about Shiny.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Eric's talk highlighted some key resources which I can use in my journey to become an advanced shiny developer.
  In particular, he discussed the best practices from the Mastering Shiny book, Shiny App Stories and Outstanding User Interfaces with Shiny.
  I haven't done much work with development for mobile shiny applications, so {shinymobile} should also be useful.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a shiny developer it's important that I follow best practices in order to create robust applications for my clients.
  This talk also made me think about the importance of the design first approach, which I'm keen to use on my next client project.
