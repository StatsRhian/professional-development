activity_description: |
  I've been watching the shiny developer series (18 episodes). 
  These are interviews with shiny developers showcasing the tools they use and approaches they take during development.
  Favourite episodes include Dean Attali, Colin Fay and Nick Strayer.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I would like to become a more advanced shiny developer.
  In order to do this I need to learn the different tools available for shiny, and how they can integrate with other technologies.
  The interviews are a great way for me to get an overview of the additional packages, whilst the demonstrations give me a more hands support.
benefit_to_users: |
  Most of the client projects that I work on involve developing shiny applications.
  As an advanced shiny developer, I'll be able to develop more robust and efficient applications for my clients.
