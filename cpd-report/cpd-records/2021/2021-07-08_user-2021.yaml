activity_description: |
  I attended the Teaching, Automation and Reproducibility session at useR! 2021.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In this session I learned about using R for automatic grading and new developments in the field of Psychology.
benefit_to_users: |
  An important part of my role at Jumping Rivers is developing infrastructure around teaching programming languagues.
  This session (which I was also speaking at) gave me some interesting ideas of packages which might be useful both internally and with my clients.
