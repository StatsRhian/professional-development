activity_description: |
  I have been reading "The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change" 
  by Camille Fournier. I've been working through the activies at the end of each chapter, and 
  discussing the contents with other senior data scientists.
benefit_to_practice: |
  My role is starting to transition from a tech-lead to a more formal manager position.
  This is a new area for me and so I'm keen to learn from the experienced of others.
  In particular this book has shaped how I think about and approach one-to-one meetings.

  If I can look after and support my people better, they should be happier and more efficient in their work for our clients.
