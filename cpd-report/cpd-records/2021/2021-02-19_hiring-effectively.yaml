  Webinar by Steph Locke on why you should hire junior software engineer.  
benefit_to_practice: |
   I found it really useful to hear a case study of the hiring process at Nightingale HQ.
   I reflected on the approach JR took for recent hiring positions and I hope use my new knowledge when we next need to recruit.
benefit_to_users: |
  By hiring effectively, we can grow the Jumping Rivers team in a way that hopefully retains talent and increases diversity.
  Hiring excellent people means that we can provide great quality consultants and trainers.
