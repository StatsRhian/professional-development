activity_description: |
  A webinar on what it's like to write/publish/translate a statistical/programming book in the early 2020s. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  I've previously been asked to contribute to writing a textbook.
  This session gave me a good understanding of what the process is like and helped me think about the best way to deliver material in a formal text book.
benefit_to_users: |
  Writing a book is a great way to support the community, it might also allow me to deliver training material in a more formal and accessible way.
