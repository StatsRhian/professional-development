activity_description: |
  I am exploring a number of different frameworks in which to create shiny applications in a robust way.
  A popular framework is using the {golem} package to deploy shiny applications from within an R package.
  I watched a number of talks on {golem} and read the book Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps
benefit_to_practice: |
  I'm a confident shiny developer but still don't feel like I work in a way that meets best practices. 
  Reading about this approach has helped clarify the ways in which I can develop robust shiny applications in a more professional manner.
  I will also start using the "documentation first" approach detailed in the book.
  This keeps UI and server components completely separate until necessary.
benefit_to_users: |
  As part of my consultancy work, I regularly develop shiny applications for clients.
  By using the {golem} infrastructure, I'll be able to develop more robust, well-structure applications for my clients.
