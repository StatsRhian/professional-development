activity_description: | 
  This was a formal exam to assess my ability to teach R programming.I
  was assessed by Dr. Greg Wilson and passed first time.
benefit_to_practice: |
  In order to prepare for this teaching exam, I had to prepare a lesson, draw a concept map, design interactive questions and create a learning persona.
  I found this process really beneficial to thinking about the way I develop  learning resources.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Completing this exam has enabled me to become a Certified RStudio Tidyverse Trainer.
  Having this qualification will confirm to clients that I am good at teaching programming.
  This will give them confidence when hiring me to deliver training that I am skilled at what I do.
