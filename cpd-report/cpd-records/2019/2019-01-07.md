activity_description: My company (Digital Rail) decided to apply for ISO9001 certification.
  I was put in charge of developing a quality management system and ensuring that
  it was robust enough to pass the certification.We passed first time and Digital
  Rail have ISO90012015 ceritication
benefit_to_practice: I hadn't written any quality assessment documents before so this
  was all new to me. I learnt how to write a quality management manual, and the key
  components required for one. I also learnt about the importance of constantly reviewing
  a QMS and the systems used to perform such reviews. Personally, I feel knowledge
  of QMSs and how to write and maintain them will be important in any future roles,
  especially consultancy.
benefit_to_users: This has huge benefit to users of my service. By writing a QMS,
  this showcases that providing a quality service is of great importance to me. Writing
  a QMS demonstrates how we will deliver a quality service, and what systems we have
  in place to ensure the service delivered meets the objectives.
