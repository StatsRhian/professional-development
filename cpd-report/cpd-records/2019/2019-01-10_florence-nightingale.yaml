activity_description: I am presented a talk to a group of school children on Randomness
  and Probabilities.
benefit_to_practice: Writing this talk made me think about the best way to explain
  complex concepts such as randomness to 16 year old girls. There were also a number
  of excellent talks which gave me inspirations for other styles of teaching I could
  try.
benefit_to_users: As a professional female mathematician I think it's important to
  demonstrate to young girls what sort of career paths are possible for them. I would
  hope that users of my service this see that as a worthwhile development, giving
  back to the STEM community. Also, being asked to present at this workshop is respected.
  Finally it demonstrates to my clients that I am able to convey complex statistical
  concepts in an understandable, digestible way.
