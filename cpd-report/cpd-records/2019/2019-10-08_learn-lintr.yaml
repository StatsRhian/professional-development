activity_description: | 
  In order to improve the R packages we write at Jumping Rivers, I had to learn about
  the {lintr} package, in particular, the update to 2.0.0.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Code style is a key component of developing good quality code. 
  By using the {lintr} package, I'm able to force all code that I create to follow these code conventions.
benefit_to_users: |
  Writing code which follows a strict coding style will help ensure that code I write for clients is clean and readable.
  Following code conventions when delivering training also showcases best practise to course attendees.
