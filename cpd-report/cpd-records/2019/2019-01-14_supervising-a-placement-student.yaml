activity_description: |
  Callum is a Computer Science student who is on placement at  Digital Rail. 
  It was my responsibility to supervise him and project manage his work.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had to manage Callum's research project, ensuring he was on task, supporting both technically and emotionally.
  His project was written in a programming language I do not use (Java Script) so we have to ensure we were communicating well and often.
  Mentoring Callum helped me develop my supervision skills, my project planning skills and my java script knowledge!
benefit_to_users:  |
  Supervising Callum really helped me improve my project management skills. 
  I had to set small achievable tasks for Callum, and monitor them frequently to ensure that the project was on track.
  Having strong project management skills is a key aspect of the service I provide to my clients as I am often the project lead.
