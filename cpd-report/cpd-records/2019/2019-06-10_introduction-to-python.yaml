activity_description: | 
  I attended a two day Introduction to Python course run by Jack
  Walton. I have already done a little python programming but had not
  received formal training before. 
benefit_to_practice: |
  As a data scientist, I frequently have to edit, format and write
  Python code. Having formal training means I have more confidence in my coding and
  have a better understanding of the language.
benefit_to_users: |
  Clients frequently come to us with Python code. By having a more
  formal knowledge of the language I will be able adapt their code and integrate it
  wit our data pipelines more easily.
