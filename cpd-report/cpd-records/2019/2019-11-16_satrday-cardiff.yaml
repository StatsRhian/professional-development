activity_description: |
  I presented a talk at the one-day conference on R held in Cardiff.
  Useful talks included Dominik Krzemi≈Ñski's talk on debugging Shiny applications and Arun Srinivasan's talk on the {datatable} package.
  Chris Jackson also gave a though provoking talk on impostor syndrome.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Arun gave a thorough introduction to {datatable}. It's not a package I've used before, as it's an alternative to the tidyverse framework.
  It was helpful to learn about the speed up in manipulation it can provide, and seen the (very different) approach to the code style.
  In work I do a lot of shiny applications so Dom's talk on debugging was very helpful.
benefit_to_users: |
  Being able to debug shiny apps efficiently will improve the development process.
