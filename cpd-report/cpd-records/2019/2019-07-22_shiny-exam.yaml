  This was a formal exam to assess my ability to code using R
  Shiny. I was assessed by Dr. Greg Wilson and passed first time.

  Having a formal qualification in the Shiny is a great achievement for me.
  It formally documents my ability to use Shiny.
benefit_to_users: |
  Completing this exam has enabled me to become a Certified RStudio Tidyverse Trainer.
  Having this qualification will confirm to clients that I am good at teaching programming and that I have a good understanding of R Shiny.
  This will give them confidence when hiring me to deliver training that I am skilled at what I do.
