activity_description: A talk from Edmund Ryan on Predicting the future repayment patterns
  of portfolios of non-performing debt using advanced  statistical modelling.
benefit_to_practice: I found it interesting that Edmund's statistical model considered fairness
  as well as profitability, setting a minimum repayment of Â£1 per month.
  This made my consider adding ethical and human components into my models.
  Good discussion about speeding up stochastic statistical models.
benefit_to_users: Knowing how to implement stochastical models in an efficient manner could
  be useful on client projects. Also an awareness of keeping models fair is very important.
