activity_description: | 
  Career Mentoring. I've been mentoring two students who are interested
  in becoming data scientists. One is an undergraduate, and one is a post-graduate.
  The scheme ran from November 2019 - May 2020. After completing his PhD, Ben was successful in securing a data science job.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  I've had to practise my active listening skills and ensure that I support the students without pushing my own thoughts onto them.
  I've practised my editing skills, helping both Ben and Theo with their C.Vs and cover letters.
  I developed my project management skills, supporting Ben in the process of selecting and applying for a job.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Being a career mentor showcases that I'm keen to support junior data scientists in their career.
  It also demonstrates that I'm supportive and a good listener.
