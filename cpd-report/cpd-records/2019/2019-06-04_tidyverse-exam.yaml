activity_description: |
  This was a formal exam to assess my ability to code using the
  Tidyverse R libraries. I was assessed by Dr. Greg Wilson and passed first time.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Having a formal qualification in the Tidyverse libraries is a
  great achievement for me. It documents my ability to use the tidyverse.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Completing this exam has enabled me to become a Certified RStudio Tidyverse Trainer.
  Having this qualification will confirm to clients that I am good at teaching programming and that I have a good understanding of the R tidyverse packages.
  This will give them confidence when hiring me to deliver training that I am skilled at what I do.
