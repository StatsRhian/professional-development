activity_description: |
  A seven hour course delivered by Greg Wilson on how to become an RStudio accredited instructor.
benefit_to_practice: |
  This course introduced me to many techniques useful for teaching tech. 
  New ideas included learning personas, mental models and formative assessment. 
  I've since incorporated all of these into the courses that I deliver at JR.
benefit_to_users: |
  Having an understanding the different ways that people learn, and how best to assess their understanding should help me deliver more engaging, successful training courses.
