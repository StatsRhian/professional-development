  Introduction for the career mentoring scheme I'm taking part in.
  There was a one-hour session led by Rob Pickersgill
  There was also networking time with other career mentors which I found really beneficial.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Rob's session on mentoring was really helpful.
  He discussed techniques such as empathy and active listening.
  He also encouraged me to reflect on what I wanted to get out of the scheme.
benefit_to_users: | 
  I believe there is a strong link between mentoring and being a good consultant.
  Rob's talk, and chatting with the other mentors gave me time to reflect on my consultancy skills, and in particular active listening.
