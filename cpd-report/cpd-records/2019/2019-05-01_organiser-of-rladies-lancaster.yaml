activity_description: | 
  I'm currently the lead organiser of the RLadies Lancaster meetup.
  We ran our launch event in May, and in 2019 we ran six events. We've led practical workshops on {dplyr}, {ggplot2}, {tidyr}, {stringr} and {lubridate}.
benefit_to_practice: |
  As a professional female programmer, I believe it's important to give back to the community.
  By running these sessions, I have to design educational content at a suitable level, and advertise the events.
  R-Ladies is also a great place way to  get to know the local R community and widen my professional network.
  I also learn lots each session, this could be a new R package that I haven't heard of, or simply a better way to explain a problem to an attendee.
benefit_to_users: |
  Organising a free, open group allows members of the public to get support with R.
  By delivering workshops to the community and supporting new learners, my clients can see that open-source development is important to me, that I'm a skilled educator and that I'm a supportive listener. 
  It might be important to clients that I support STEM education programmes for women.
  This also demonstrates to clients that I an active member in the R North West community.
