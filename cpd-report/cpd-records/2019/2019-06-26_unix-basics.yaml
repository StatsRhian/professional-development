activity_description: |
  I worked through the online materials "Shell Novice" put together by the Data Carpentries.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I often have to work in the Unix shell whilst using git or navigating around my laptop. 
  I wanted to increase my knowledge of the shell to allow me to work more efficiently, and learn more about writing shell scripts.
benefit_to_users: |
  Having good shell scripting skills will allow me to work more efficiently on client projects, 
  and write bash scripts as part of consultancy projects.
