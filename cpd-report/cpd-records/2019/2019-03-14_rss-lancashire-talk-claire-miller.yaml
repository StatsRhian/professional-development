 Claire spoke about global lake water quality and the statistical challenges associated with modelling ecological systems.
 The GloboLakes Project used long-term satellite observations in order to estimate the water quality of lakes and look for spatial similarities. 
 Claire showed us visualisations of both the satellite data and the water samples over time, and highlighted the difficulties of matching up the
 insitu samples with remote sensing data.

  Claire discussed the many challenges faced including dimensionality and missing data.
  For example, one of her sensors stopped working early on in the project, forcing her to find an alternative data source.
  This reminded me of the importance of planning ahead and making project risk assessments, to ensure that when challenges occur, there is a potential back up.
  Claire also discussed how making her research accessible via the development of an R package impacted her project.
  This reminded me the importance of open-source work and encouraged me to consider developing packages where appropriate.

  Creating a risk assessment at the start of a consultancy project will reassure clients that I have considered the potential challenges
  and am prepared to handle any unexpected problems arising.
