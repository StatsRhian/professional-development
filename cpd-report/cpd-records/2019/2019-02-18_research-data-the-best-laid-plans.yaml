activity_description: | 
  The session took the form of structured discussions and activities rather than talks.
  Topics included preparing data for collection, identifying existing suitable datasets, and ensuring that our data is well managed through the whole lifecycle.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Managing data sets is a key role of a statistician. The discussions I had with my peers helped me reflect on the data sets I currently depend on,
  and whether I'm storing them in the optimal way to support analysis both known and unknown.
benefit_to_users: |
  Often when supporting clients with statistical consultancy, they haven't identified their data source .
  This session helped me think abut how I can best ensure that the correct data is collected first time around, minimising effort and cost for the client.
