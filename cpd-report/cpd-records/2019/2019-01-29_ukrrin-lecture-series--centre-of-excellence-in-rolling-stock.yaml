activity_description: |
 UKRRIN organised a series of lectures at the Institute of Railway Research, Huddersfield University.
 Topics included risk modelling, novel braking systems and a wheel motor project.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  As a data scientist, I frequently have to work on domain specific problems. 
  In my current role, I specialise in railways, although I have no formal engineering or railway experience.
  These talks broadened my domain specific knowledge, this will help me work in this sector in future, and enable me to communicate with railway engineers.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a digital railway data scientist, having good domain knowledge is key.
  By attending this lecture series, I demonstrate to users of my service that I am willing to develop my domain knowledge.
