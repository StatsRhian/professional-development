  There were many fantastic, relevant talks and I left this conference with lots of new learnings.learnings
  Useful talks included combining Shiny with R Markdown, new developments in {dplyr}, enhancements to {tidyr}, {golem}, {goodpractise} for package development and reusing tidyverse code with {rlang}. code

  I left the conference with a huge list of R packages to investigate further. 
  The talks on best practise gave me excellent advise which I have since incorporated into my coding.

  As an expert in R development, it's essential for me to be informed on the latest developments.
  Attending the useR! conference is one of the best ways for me to update my knowledge and engage with the R community.
