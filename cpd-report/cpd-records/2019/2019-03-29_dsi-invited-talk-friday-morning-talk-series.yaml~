activity_description: A talk from Edmund Ryan on Predicting the future repayment patterns
  of portfolios of non-performing debt using advanced  statistical modelling.
benefit_to_practice: I found it interesting that Edmund's statistical model considered fairness
  as well as profitability, setting a minimum repayment of Â£1 per month.
  Good discussion about speeding up stochastic statistical models.
benefit_to_users:
