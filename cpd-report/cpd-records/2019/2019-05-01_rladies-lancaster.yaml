activity_description: The launch of R-Ladies Lancaster.
  I spoke about unusual uses for R in daily life.
  There were also talks from Nic Crane on Ten Steps to Becoming a Tidyverse and
  Lucy Morgan on building an R package.
benefit_to_practice: Nic taught me about the importance of contributing to open-source
  projects, and demonstrated the best ways for new developers to get involved.
  Lucy taught building a package, and highlighed some good resources for beginners.
benefit_to_users: By delivering workshops to the community and supporting new learners,
  my clients can see that  Open-source development is important to me, that I'm a skilled
  educator and that I'm a supportive listener. It might be important to clients that I support
  STEM education programmes for women. This also demonstrates to clients that I am
  a key member in the R North West community.
