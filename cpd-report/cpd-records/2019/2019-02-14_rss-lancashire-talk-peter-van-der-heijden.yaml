activity_description: |
  Peter gave a talk about population size estimation where linking registers
  results in incomplete covariates.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  Peter's talk introduced me to a new challenge in population estimation,
  and how linking multiple registers and using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm
  can be used to solve this. These methods are applied to hard-to-reach populations.
  Applications include victims of human trafficking, the homeless, domestic violence,
  illegal immigrants etc. It was interesting to think about this problem from a modelling
  perspective.
benefit_to_users: |
  If users of my service came to me with a population estimations
  problem for a hard-to-reach population, e.g shelter estimating homelessness - I'd
  know what research to consider, and how to decide if the model was appropriate.
