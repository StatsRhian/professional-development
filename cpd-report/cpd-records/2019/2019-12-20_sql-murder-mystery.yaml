activity_description: |
  I decided I wanted to brush up on SQL. I completed the SQL murder
  mystery tutorial online.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I haven't used SQL before. I wanted to gain basic knowledge of
  the commands, so I can communicate better with clients and attendees at my R training.
benefit_to_users: |
  Many of our clients use SQL, so having a basic understanding of SQL commands can help me understand their data bases.
  Also, when teaching people how to use R, many of them know SQL, but not R.
  By understanding basic SQL, I can make comparisons between R and SQL, hopefully cementing their knowledge.
  This is particularly relevant when teaching the dplyr & tidyr package.
