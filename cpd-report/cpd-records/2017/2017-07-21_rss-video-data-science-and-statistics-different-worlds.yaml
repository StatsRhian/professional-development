activity_description: A panel of data scientist and statisticians discussing the
  role that data science plays within the field of statistics.
  Has the relevance of statistics been diminished because of new types of data or technologies which need a radical new approach?
    Is data science about ‘getting the job done’, and statistics about the deeper scientific understanding?
    Are our universities offering students the right skill sets to meet the high demand for data scientists
benefit_to_practice: I really enjoyed this discussion. Often, people ask me if I identify
  as a statistician or a data scientist, and what the difference is between the two.
  These talks helped to clarify my thoughts and provided interesting angles on the
  discussion. It got me thinking about the similarities and differences between the
  disciplines. It also encouraged me to reflect on the skills I have as someone who
  sits in the middle of statistics and data science.
benefit_to_users: The personal reflection helped me identify the strengths that I
  have due to my abilities in the intersection statistics and data science, and skills
  which may need development. Targetting these skills will ensure I provide a good
  service to users of my service.
