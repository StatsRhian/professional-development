activity_description:
- The Florence Nightingale Days are part of our continuing efforts to promote mathematics
  and statistics to young women in years 10 and above, who will soon be making crucial
  choices in their career paths. The Florence Nightingale Day will showcase successful
  women in mathematics at various stages of their careers, display information about
  the broad range of possibilities offered by a degree in mathematics or statistics,
  stimulate informal discussion between pupils and mathematicians and give an opportunity
  for participants to compare their mathematical skills with their peers in other
  schools via a quiz.This year I tutored during the quiz.

  annual conference with talks from key researchers from Statistics, Operational Research

benefit_to_practice:
- Discussing the mathematical questions with the 16-17-year-olds made me think about
  how best to communicate mathematical principles in a simple way.
- The STOR-i conference highlights up-to-date statistical methodology. Increasing
  my knowledge of new techniques in extreme value theory, changepoints and statistical
  learning.
benefit_to_users:
- Practising communicating statistical principles with non-specialist people is excellent
  practice for liaising with clients.
- Ensuring that I am up-to-date with the latest statistical methodology allows me
  to provide relevant analysis for my clients.
