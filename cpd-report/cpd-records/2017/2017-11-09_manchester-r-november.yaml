activity_description: An R meetup in Manchester. Presentations were on Neural Nets (Martin Eastwood), Reproducibility (Tania Allard) and R in production (David Springate).
benefit_to_practice: Martin gave an in-depth introduction to neural networks. Although
  I was aware of this technique before, something about how he explained everything
  really made something click for me. I feel my understanding of them, and confidence
  to use them has increased. I've thought about reproducibility a lot and therefore
  most of Tania's talk did not convey new information. However, she did introduce
  me to workflowR, and R package which I am keen to try out. Using this will help
  my improve my whole workflow with in R. I have also decided to investigate using
  docker. David's talk really got me thinking about using R in production. Although
  I think for the work that I do, it is still the right solution,  He highlighted
  some work around that can be used to help R be more stable in production. These
  technologies included Packrat, install_github(“hadley/strict”) and Data.table
benefit_to_users: By implementing the knowledge I have gained through this session,
  I will aim to provide a client service which meets gold standards for reproducibility.
