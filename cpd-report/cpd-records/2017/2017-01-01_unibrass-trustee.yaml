activity_description: |
  I served as secretary and trustee for the UniBrass Foundation.
  The UniBrass Foundation set up to advance, improve, develop and maintain public education in, and appreciation of, the art of the brass band movement, especially at universities.
  They aim to do this primarily by organising the annual UniBrass Championships, offering support to existing university ensembles, and encouraging the creation of new university bands.
benefit_to_practice: |
  As secretary, I was responsible for writing minutes, liaising with the Charity Commission and ensuring that the constitution is up to date.
benefit_to_users: |
  As part of my role, I had to learn how to write GDPR and child protection policies.
  I also had to learn how to update the charitable objectives.
  These writing skills can be transferred to ensuring that any policies developed in my professional work are correct.
