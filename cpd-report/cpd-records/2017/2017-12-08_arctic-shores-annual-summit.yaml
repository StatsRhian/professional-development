activity_description: Presentations from different employees of Arctic Shores. There were talks
  on Upgrades to the DataHub, the History of Psychometrics, Inspector
  Help and Automating interview questions
benefit_to_practice: The variety of talks from different departments of Arctic Shores
  made the session very interesting and beneficial for me. Working as a lone statistician
  in a psychology company, it's vital to connect with the other departments. The talk
  from the DataHub about Inspector Help highlighted functionality with the DataHub
  which I did not previously know about. The Psychologist provided a history of psychometrics
  which was fascinating and helped me understand where the development of our tests
  have come from. The client services team showcased a new product in development
  which I will be working on in the near future. I also gave a talk on my work exploring
  the relationship between traits and levels which was apparently very useful.
benefit_to_users: Understanding how the company works, and what projects other departments
  are working on is vital to providing a great service to our clients.
