activity_description: |
  The presentations were on Hypothesis testing (Catherine Leigh), Analysing running data (Kaylea Haynes) and {shinytest} (Chris Campbell).
benefit_to_practice: |
  Although I use shiny regularly, and am aware of the importance of testing code, I had not heard of {shinytest}.
  Chris introduced the R package {shinytest} and demonstrated how easily tests can be implemented into shiny apps.
benefit_to_users: |
  Learning about {shinytest} has inspired me to include testing inall shiny apps that I develop.
  This should help flag up any bugs quickly, creating a more dependable service for our users.
