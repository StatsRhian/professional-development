activity_description: I worked through the first hald of the R4DS book in Autumn 2017. 
  This book focuses on teaching how to do data science with R. I learned how to use key tidyverse packages such as dplyr, tidyr and ggplot2. 
benefit_to_practice: This book is the gold standard for data science in R. Working
  through the book taught me new skills, particularly in visualising data using ggplot.
benefit_to_users: Having strong R skills are essential for both analysing client data,
  but also visualising their data in a clear, intuitive way.
