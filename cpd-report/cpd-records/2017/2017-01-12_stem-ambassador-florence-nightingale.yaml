  I volunteered at the annual Florence Nightingale Day. This event showcases successful women in mathematics at various stages of their careers, and displays information about the broad range of possibilities offered by a degree in mathematics or statistics.
  This year I tutored during the mathematics quiz.
benefit_to_practice: Discussing the mathematical questions with the 16-17-year-olds
  made me think about how best to communicate mathematical principles in a simple
  way.
benefit_to_users: Practising communicating statistical principles with non-specialist
  people is excellent practice for liaising with clients.
