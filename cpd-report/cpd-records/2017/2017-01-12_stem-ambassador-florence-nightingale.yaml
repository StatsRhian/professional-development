activity_description: The Florence Nightingale Days are part of our continuing efforts
  to promote mathematics and statistics to young women in years 10 and above, who
  will soon be making crucial choices in their career paths. The Florence Nightingale
  Day will showcase successful women in mathematics at various stages of their careers,
  display information about the broad range of possibilities offered by a degree in
  mathematics or statistics, stimulate informal discussion between pupils and mathematicians
  and give an opportunity for participants to compare their mathematical skills with
  their peers in other schools via a quiz.This year I tutored during the quiz.
benefit_to_practice: Discussing the mathematical questions with the 16-17-year-olds
  made me think about how best to communicate mathematical principles in a simple
  way.
benefit_to_users: Practising communicating statistical principles with non-specialist
  people is excellent practice for liaising with clients.
