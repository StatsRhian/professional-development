activity_description: Tassos talked about OpenStreetCab, a mobile service for taxi price comparison. He discused the open datasets that made the app possible and gave insights on urban transport economics and routing behaviour.
benefit_to_practice: It was fascinating to hear how Tassos has taken an academic project
  right through to a real-life app. This made me think about how important it is to
  have a focus when developing a new product.  There was also an excellent networking
  event where I met local data scientists.
benefit_to_users: My work involves taking academic ideas and bring them right through
  to the Technology Readiness Level 10. Hearing Tassos's story helped me re-think
  the importance of including customers at all levels throughout the process.
