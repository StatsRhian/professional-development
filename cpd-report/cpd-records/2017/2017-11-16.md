activity_description: The Data Science Radar as a conceptual framework that allows
  users to explore these character traits in more detail and to uncover their own
  data science profile type. https//www.mango-solutions.com/radar/Results By creating
  quantitative descriptions of your data, you create insight that is a key deliverable
  for your team.You interpret the meaningful reasons for features in a dataset.You
  also pay attention to the detail of underlying assumptions, limits and exceptions
  when describing a system.You are familiar with a variety of mathematical methods
  for describing dynamic systems and are highly skilled in using software that implements
  these.You use a variety of graphical and numeric techniques to verify that you are
  delivering a high quality result that can be used to predict and optimise future
  performance.When you are on the team, if there is information that can be gleaned
  from a system, you will find it.Communicator 4.3Visualiser 3.8Technologist 3.4Data

benefit_to_practice: I have a tendancy to try and be good at everything rather than
  specialising in specific skills. Looking at my radar has reminded me of the skills
  which are less important in the roles that I do. I think I should focus on maintaining
  my Modelling, Programming and Communication skills rather than trying to keep on
  top of all the new different technologies (Docker, Hadoop etc.)
benefit_to_users: On an enterprise level, the Data Science Radar can help team leaders
  in the following waysTo help shape a bespoke data science training course for your
  team by objectively identifying the training requirements of your existing staff.To
  monitor learning during a long-term data science training programme.As a visual
  aid to support your data scientist recruitment requirements, and to highlight where
  there are gaps in the skill set of your existing team and to identify the skill
  sets of potential new recruits.
