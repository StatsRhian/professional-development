activity_description: David Spiegelhalter - Trust in NumbersThose who value quantitative
  and scientific evidence are faced with claims both of a reproducibility crisis in
  scientific publication, and of a post-truth society abounding in fake news and alternative
  facts.  Both issues are of vital importance to statisticians, and both are deeply
  concerned with trust in expertise.  By considering the ‘pipelines’ through which
  scientific and political evidence is propagated, I will consider possible ways of
  improving both the trustworthiness of the statistical evidence being communicated,
  and the ability of audiences to assess the quality and reliability of what they
  are being told.
benefit_to_practice: David's talk presented a number of excellent examples which I
  can use in my role as an RSS Statistical ambassador. The pipelines that he discussed
  has encouraged me to take responsibility for the way that my research is communicated.
  I will do this by ensuring that all press releases are accompanied by more public-friendly
  versions, there by helping University press offices do there work.
benefit_to_users: In my role as statistical ambassador for the RSS, David has provided
  me with many excellent examples which I can share when educating members of the
  public.
