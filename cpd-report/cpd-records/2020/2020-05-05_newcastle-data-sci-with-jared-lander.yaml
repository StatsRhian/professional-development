activity_description: |
  The (online) Newcastle Data Science Meetup with Jared Lander. Jared talked about different statistical models and how to best visualise their components.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Jared gave some excellent examples of visualising models which gave me ideas.
  In particular I liked his use of the coef plot to compare multiple models.
  The coefficient distribution plots are also a nice way to visualise model uncertainty.
benefit_to_users: |
  When I implement a statistical model for a client, it's important that I am able to communicate the components of the model to the client.
  Visualisation is a great tool for this, and in particular I think that coefplot is a great technique for comparing model components.
