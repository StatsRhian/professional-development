  Annual conference of the STOR-i CDT. Showcasing statistics and operational research in industrial application.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  The STOR-i conference is a great way for me to keep up to date with new research in statistics, especially in cluster analysis.
  Useful talks included Tom Flowerdew's insights on data science pipelines and Christine Currie's talk on stochastic processes.
benefit_to_users: |
  The conference is a great way to keep informed on recent statistical development.
  Being up-to-date with statistical methodology developments broadens the areas in which I can support my clients.
