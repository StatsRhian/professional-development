activity_description: |
  The RSS wanted to put out an article explaining covid numbers and terminology. In this meeting we discussed and planned the article.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Putting this article together forced me to simplify the complexity of Covi and pandemic modelling models into a simple, useful article.
  Practising this skill with fellow Statistical Ambassadors was ueful as they all have different ways of communicating. 
benefit_to_users: |
  It's important that I can take complex terminology and models and explain them in a simple way to clients and their stakeholders. Taking part in this session helped develop those co  mmunication skills.
