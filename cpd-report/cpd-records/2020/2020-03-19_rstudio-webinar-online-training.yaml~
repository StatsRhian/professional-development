activity_description: RStudio Webinar for certified trainers on Teaching online on short notice
benefit_to_practice: The session had lots of great tips to keep learners engag  ed, and also managing an online classroom. I need to convert all of our trai  ning courses to an online format this month so this was a very useful session.
benefit_to_users: From now on, I'll be teaching online. This session has helped me think about how to adapt my courses to be as engaging and useful as possible for the learners.
