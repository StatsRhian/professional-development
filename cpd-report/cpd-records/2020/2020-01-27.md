activity_description: RStudio Conference WorkshopsI was TAing on Rob Hyndman's Tidy
  Time Series workshopHis course covered 12 hours of material, including manipulating,
  plotting and forecasting time series.
benefit_to_practice: I have strong R skills and decent experience at time series analysis,
  however I had not combined the two before. By teaching (and therefore learning)
  the Tidy Time Series material, I was able to learn the state of the art R libaries
  used to analyse time series data. Specifically I learnt the tsibble, feasts and
  fable R packages. I also refreshed some statistical time series analysis theory,
  including calculation of Auto Correlation Functions and rules of thumb for model
  fitting.
benefit_to_users: Having an in depth, up-to-date knowledge of time series analysis
  in R will allow me to write robust analysis for client data with time series data.I
  was already able to perform time series analysis in R, however, using the framework
  defined by the tsibble packages will allow any code I write for clients to integrate
  well with the tidyverse. This is important to many clients as the tidyverse is seen
  as a standard coding framework in the R community.
