activity_description: I subscribe to the R Weekly newsletter. 
  Once a fortnight, I sit down and review the recent articles, 
  reading blogs and making notes on new information.
  Learning varies from package developments and new functions, to best practises for teaching.
benefit_to_practice: The new R packages and functions I learn about in these sessions
  increase the size of my rstats toolbox. 
benefit_to_users: As a leader in RStats consultancy and training, it's
  important for me to be up to date with the latest developments.
