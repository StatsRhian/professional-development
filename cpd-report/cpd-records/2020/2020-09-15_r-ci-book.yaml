activity_description: I am co-authoring a book on R and continuous integration with Colin Gillespie.
  This process involves researching how best to use tools like Git, Travis and GitHub Actions.
benefit_to_practice: Researching, writing and editing a book has taught me so much about git and continuous
  integration. I've had to delve deep into topics in order to understand them well enough to teach them.
benefit_to_users: My knowledge of continuous integration and in particular git has dramatically improved.
  I have a much deeper understanding of git, which will help me set up sensible workflows for my clients.
