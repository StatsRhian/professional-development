  I'm trying to grow and improve my professional identity. An important part of this is the
  brand I choose to portray. Nick encouraged me to think about my target audience,
  and what aspects make me stand out against the crowd. I believe that developing
  a strong personal brand will help me connect with potential clients.

  Creating a strong personal brand forces me to define my skills, and act professionally.
  This will in turn provide a clearer, more professional service to my clients. Having
  a strong brand may also help my clients demonstrate to their stakeholders, the quality
  and caliber in my work.
