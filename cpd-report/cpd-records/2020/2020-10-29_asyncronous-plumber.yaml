activity_description: |
  A colleague asked me to develop an asynchronous API for his project.
  As part of this I had to learn about asynchronous APIs, and the R packages {plumber} and {future}.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  {plumber} is a package I've wanted to learn about for a while.
  It allows you to create web APIs directly from R.
  This increases my options when choosing a deployment method.
benefit_to_users: | 
  Clients often request deployment via API.
  I now have an understanding of how to deploy an API, and how to manage asynchronous API requests.
