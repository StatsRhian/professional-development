  An RStudio webinar on the different resources available for online teaching.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Mine shared some excellent resources with us which I intend to try out in my online teaching.
  She also gave some good tips of converting boring code into interactive online tutorials. In particular it was great to hear Mine's experiences of using RStudio cloud.
benefit_to_users: |
  As a provider of online training, it's important for me to be up-to-date with the latest tools for delivering online training, and techniques to keep sessions engaging.
  This session will improve the quality of online training I can provide.
