activity_description: |
  I spoke at a PyData Lancaster meetup about continuous integration.
  The other speaker was James Walkerdine, Co-Founder of Relative Insight.
  He told us the story of how he started a language analytics and data science company,
  and how it has changed and grown into a sustainable business.
benefit_to_practice: |
  James gave a great presentation explaining how his data science company grew from a small size
  to having three international offices. I learnt about how to support the growth of a data science team, 
  and tips on ensuring clients feel supported. I also had some useful discussions with attendees about 
  continuous integration techniques.
benefit_to_users: |
  The discussions I had with other attendees introduced me to alternative CI solutions to Travis.
  This will be useful when discussing deployment options with clients.
  My learning from James's talk will help me foster sustainable growth within my own team, hopefully leading
  to a happier, more productive team and therefore better output.
