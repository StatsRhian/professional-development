activity_description: |
  In 2020, I've been participating in peer mentoring sessions with Benjamin Wolfe who I met through #RStats. We meet once a month to check in on our data science projects, work, and self-development.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Although these started as an informal chat to stay in touch, I've found these sessions very beneficial to my professional development. We regularly reflect on working practice, statistical resources and data science best practice. 
benefit_to_users: |
  These reflection sessions have helped me consider which areas of my development to focus on, and how I can develop these skills to support my clients.
