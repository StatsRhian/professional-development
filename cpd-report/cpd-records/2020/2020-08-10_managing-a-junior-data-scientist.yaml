activity_description: |
  In work I've begun managing a junior data scientist. I'm responsible for planning his work scheduling,
  monitoring his performance, and supporting his development.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Managing John has helped me reflect on workload scheduling and priorities. We have weekly scheduling sessions,
  where we choose the most important tasks, and estimate the time required to complete them. I'm having to
  choose a management style, improve my listening skills and balance supporting him whilst also enabling independent growth.
benefit_to_users: |
  The listening and support skills which I'm developing in my role as a manager will enable me to better manage the teams I work with on client projects.
