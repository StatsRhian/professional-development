activity_description: |
  I taught a course on efficient programming in R.
  In preparation for this, I learnt material on benchmarking, object growth and parallel programming.
  Main resources were the books Efficient R Programming & Advanced R.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I've always had a vague understanding of efficiencies in R programming, however this period of learning forced me to really understand the main concepts.
  I learnt how R handles objects in memory, the best tools for benchmarking code, and the options available to R users wanting to parallelise code.
benefit_to_users: |
  Having a good understanding of programming efficiencies in R will allow me to provide code reviews for my clients, write efficient code for them, and provide advise if they want to consider parallelisation.
