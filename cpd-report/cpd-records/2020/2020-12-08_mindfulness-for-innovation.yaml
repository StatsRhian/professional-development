activity_description: |
  Mindfulness for Innovation was run by Alan Ross on behalf of the Innovation SuperNetwork. Alan led a number of meditations sessions, and we had a discussion about how mindfulness could support innovators.
benefit_to_practice: |
  I had some experience with mediation previously, but had stopped practising. I was mostly interested in attending this session to understand how
  meditation can help with innovation and deep work. However, it mostly highlighted to me that I am approaching burnout, and have a very restless mind.
  I've since re-introduced short meditation sessions into my working day. I've found that even short sessions can help prepare me for focussed, distraction free sessions. 
benefit_to_users: |
  Managing my mental health will me become a better, more focused and supportive consultant. I've also found that I'm able to better focus on hard tasks - working better.
