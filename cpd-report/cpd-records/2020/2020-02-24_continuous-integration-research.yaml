activity_description: |
  In preperation for some talks I'm giving, and my developer role in work, I watched a
  number of talks on continuous integration strategies on YouTube.
benefit_to_practice: |
  Continuous integration is essential for efficient, robust code development. 
  Through these videos I learnt about different git branching strategies, and which ones lend themselves well to CI.
benefit_to_users: |
  Continuous integration and git branching strategies are a key part of developing functioning code.
  Having a good understanding of the options will allow me to make better informed decisions when working with clients.
