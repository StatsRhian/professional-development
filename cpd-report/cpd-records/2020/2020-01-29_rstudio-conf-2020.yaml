  The RStudio conference is an annual global conference for all users of R.
  As an R expert and an RStudio partner, it's a massively valuable conference from both a learning and a networking perspective.
  I attended a number of talks and was working on our booth throughout the conference.

  In particular, I found the following talks very useful, Ryan Timpe's talk about learning R with humorous side projects, Kevin Ushey's talk on renv, and Jenny Bryan's keynote about debugging.
  I learnt new skills related to deploying models in a reproducible manner and picked up some great tips about debugging.
  I left the conference with a long list of new R packages to learn, and practices to start implementing in my working day.

  One of the main reasons clients come to us is for advice using R and RStudio products. By being informed and up-to-date with developments in the #RStats community, this means my clients will be confident they are getting a robust solution.
