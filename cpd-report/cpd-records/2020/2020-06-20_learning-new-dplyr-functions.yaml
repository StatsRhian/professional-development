activity_description: |
  This year there was a significant release of a very popular R package - dplyr.
  I spent some time reading and playing with the new functionality to ensure I'm up to date.
  Examples include the across() function and the slice_*() family
benefit_to_practice: |
  In particular learning about the across() function has improved the quality my code.
  This function allows me to apply the same transformation to many columns, minimising code duplication.
benefit_to_users: | 
  As an R expert, it's essential that I am up-to-date with important developments in the popular R packages.
