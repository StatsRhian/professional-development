activity_description: Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive
  web apps straight from R. In this beginner-friendly session, we'll be working through
  part one of the RStudio shiny tutorial.https//shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/This will
  be an interactive session so please bring your laptop. Ideally, this should have
  R and RStudio installed. If you have trouble downloading these, you can use https//rstudio.cloud/.
  You will also need the shiny R package. Please, install this before coming along
  to the session. You can do this by running install.packages(shiny) in R.
