activity_description: |
  I learnt about Shiny Modules, a way using functions in your Shiny apps to make you code more modular.
  I worked through a tutorial, read many articles, and implemented a demo example.
benefit_to_practice: | 
  I regularly develop Shiny applications, but didn't know what Shiny modules were or how to use them.
  I am working on a large application for a client which lots of repeated code so this seemed like a great time to learn.
  I'll use my knowledge of Shiny modules in all my Shiny app development going forward. 
benefit_to_users: | 
  Using Shiny modules means that my code is more modular.
  This makes it much easier to read, de-bug and test.
  Clients will benefit from cleaner code and a better final product.
