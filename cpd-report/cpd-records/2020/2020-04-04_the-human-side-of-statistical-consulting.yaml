activity_description: |
  I wanted to reflect on how I can be a better consultant, especially within the field statistics and data. I studied this book, reflected on my own experience and practice and made notes. 
benefit_to_practice: | 
  It was beneficial to reflect on what makes a good consultant.
  I reflected on the minimal required knowledge and identified topics which I could improve on.
  I also compared the suggested scoping questions with ones that I tend to use whilst scoping.
benefit_to_users: |
  Reflecting on my practice as a statistical consultant mostly got me thinking about how I can best set expectations at the start of a project, and work with the client to ensure that the project best meets their needs.
