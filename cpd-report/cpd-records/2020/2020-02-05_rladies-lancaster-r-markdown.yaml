activity_description:
- I co-lead the R-Ladies meet up. I assisted Rebecca with the workshop aspect of her talk,
  and then I presented my own talk on the RStudio conference.
benefit_to_practice:
- As a professional female programmer, I believe it's important to give back to the
  community. By running these sessions, I have to design educational content at a
  suitable level. I also have to organise the sessions, and advertise them.  R-Ladies
  is also a great place to connect with like minded professionals and discuss issues
  and finding in the R community. It's a great networking opportunity for me.I also
  learn lots each session, this could be a new R package that I haven't heard of,
  or simply a better way to explain a problem to an attendee.
benefit_to_users:
- By delivering workshops to the community and supporting new learners, my clients
  can see that1) Open-source development is important to me2) I'm a skilled educator3)
  I'm a supportive listenerIt might be important to clients that I support STEM education
  programmes for women.This also demonstrates to clients that I am a key member in
  the R North West community.
