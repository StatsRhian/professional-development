activity_description: Do you have an innovative product and service that is ready
  for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?Or
  are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling
  stock, infrastructure or stations?If so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition
  will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the
  first time in real-world rail environments.”The themes for this FoaK2 competition
  areDecarbonising the railways Decarbonisation is a priority across the network,
  including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a
  challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies,
  energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies,
  novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.Customer experience
  in stations This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be
  integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision
  of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions
  to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision
  of the ‘station of the future’.Innovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport
  (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail
  sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness
  and integration into the railway system.FoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery
  of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the
  expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.Innovations

benefit_to_practice: This session taught me the essentials of writing a government
  grant, skills of which I require regularly in my current role.
benefit_to_users: Writing good government grants (and hopefully getting them!) showcases
  that we know how to successfully take a project from idea to completion.
