activity_description: |
  Davide Pigoli spoke about analysing of acoustic phonetic data. He was exploring the phonetic changes between different languages using audio recordings. Davide's approach used the log-spectrograms of speech recordings and compared the frequency covariance functions.
benefit_to_practice: |
  It was interesting to learn how it is possible to analyse acoustical data using Fourier analysis. In particular, separating word differences and language differences.
benefit_to_users: |
  Expanding the types of data that we are able to analysis broadens the services that we are able to provide.
