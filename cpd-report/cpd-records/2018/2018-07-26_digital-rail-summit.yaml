  An all-day, company wide summit. Sessions included SWOT analysis, value propositions, routes to market and how to make a business valueable.

  As a new employee to Digital Rail, this was an invaluable experience to help me understand the full business, the different areas and challenges.
benefit_to_users: |
  I now have a more thorough understanding of the market that Digital Rail operates in. In particular, the session on value propositions was really insightful. We have begun to build this into our product development, to ensure that we are meeting the customers' needs at all time by matching customer needs with a product solution.
