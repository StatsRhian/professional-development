activity_description: Code for Lancaster is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup.
  This was the first session, and discussions revolved around “How might we better enable
  locals to be aware of local events”. 
benefit_to_practice: Useful networking session, mixing with full stack developers
  as well as data scientists and statisticians.
benefit_to_users: A number of the topics came back to discussing the What services
  can we provide vs What services do the users actually want? These discussions made
  me re-think the services that we currently provide and encouraged me to focus on
  the customer.
