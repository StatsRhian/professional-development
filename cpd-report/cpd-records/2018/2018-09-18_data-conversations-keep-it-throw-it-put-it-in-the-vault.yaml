activity_description: |
  This session focussed on the long term value of data. Questions discussed included how to make sure data is accessible in the future, should we keep all our data, and how can we assess what has long term value? 
benefit_to_practice: |
  The speakers discussed their experiences with data, particularly how storing data that they hadn't expected to be useful was important in their analysis. We had some interesting discussions about lost data and personal data.
benefit_to_users: |
  One of the first steps with users is discussing what data they have or deciding what data should be collected. Discussing best practises of data storage and collection will ensure we make the most of all available client data.
