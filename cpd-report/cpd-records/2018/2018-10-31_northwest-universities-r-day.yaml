  There were keynotes from Andy Field and Robin Lovelace, as well as flash talks, a poster session and workshops in the afternoon. I attended Chris Campell's workshop on The curse of the unspecified data definition.
benefit_to_practice: |
  This was a hugely beneficial day for me. The talks covered a broad range of topics and techniques from interactive teaching with the R language, to reproducible data analysis. I have plenty of great resources to take away and work through. It was also a great networking opportunity.
benefit_to_users: |
  In particular the workshop with Chris Campbell taught me the importance of clearly defined data rules when dealing with client data. By implementing the principles and techniques that I learnt in the workshop, we will be able to provide a more robust data service for our clients.
