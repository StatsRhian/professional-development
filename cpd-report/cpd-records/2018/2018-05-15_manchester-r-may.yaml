activity_description: Talks on RStudio Projects (Rachel Naylor), Interpretable Machine
  Learning (Pantelis Hadjipantelis) and Storytelling with R (Rob England). There was also a tutorial on sparklyr by Chris Campbell.
benefit_to_practice: The sparklyr workshop was an excellent introduction to using
  Spark with in RStudio. I aim to add this to my toolbox of techniques. The RStudio
  Projects talk from Rachel gave some great tips on how to improve my quality assurance. 
benefit_to_users: Spark is a big data technology. Using it will allow us to handle
  large data sets in a much more computationally efficient way.
