activity_description: I volunteered to tutor online for 2 hours as an R expert
benefit_to_practice: The tutoring session involved me re-visiting the Tidyverse. Explaining
  these concepts to a beginner helped my improve my communication and tutoring skills.
  Explaining programming concepts over a messaging service can be challenging, and
  practising this allowed me to trial new techniques.
benefit_to_users: Improved communication, especially relating to coding and programming
  is vital for  delivering an understandable service.
