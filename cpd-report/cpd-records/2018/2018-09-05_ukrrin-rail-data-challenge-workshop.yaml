  The Centre of Excellence in Digital Systems (CEDS) at BCRRE hosted a workshop on the Rail Data Challenge. This challenge is an open invitation for innovators, developers and tech experts to develop new technologies to address three current rail challenges. The workshop introduced the challenges, available data sets, potential partners (DfT, RDG, RSSB) the available data and  facilitated breakout sessions.
benefit_to_practice: |
  This session taught me about UKKRIN, a university research group in rail. Learning about the different projects they were working on is useful as we may need to team up with some of their academics in future projects. We also had a break out session where we discussed the problems in the rail industry and brainstormed technologies which would be useful in solving them.

  Working with large research organisations expands the type of products which we can develop. Developing new technologies means we can offer new products to our clients which meet the needs of the rail industry.
