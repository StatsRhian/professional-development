activity_description: The Centre of Excellence in Digital Systems (CEDS) at BCRRE
  is a part of the UK Rail Research and Innovation Network. CEDS will host this briefing
  and workshop on the Rail Data Challenge which recently opened and is accepting applications
  until the middle of September.The Rail Data Challenge is an open invitation for
  innovators, developers and tech experts to develop new technologies to address three
  current rail challenges using new and existing datasets.Challenge winners will get
  the opportunity to pitch for funding from industry and private investors to demonstrate
  their solution into rail. This competition will take place from 16 August and will
  conclude with a Demo Day on 15 October (2018).At this Briefing and Workshop, participants
  will be able to find out more from the DfT, RDG and RSSB about the Joint Rail Data
  Action Plan and the Rail Data Challenge. In addition, there will be a workshop and
  opportunities to test ideas and explore collaboration opportunities with academics,
  tech experts, innovators and SMEs.Workshop Itinerary1400 Welcome to BCRRE/UKRRIN

benefit_to_practice: This session taught me about UKKRIN a university research group
  in rail. Learning about the different projects they were working on is useful as
  we may need to team up with some of their academics in future projects. We also
  had a break out session where we discussed the problems in the rail industry and
  brainstormed technologies which would be useful in solving them.
benefit_to_users: Working with large research organisations expanded the type of products
  which we can develop. Developing new technologies means we can offer new products
  to our clients which meet the needs of the rail industry.
