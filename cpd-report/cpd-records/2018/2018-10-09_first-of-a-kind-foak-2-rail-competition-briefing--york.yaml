activity_description: A briefing day for the First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition.
  The competition was to identifying high TRL products and test them in real-world
  railway environment. The session explained more detail about the competiton, how
  to apply and had a session on grant writing.
benefit_to_practice: This session taught me the essentials of writing a government
  grant, skills of which I require regularly in my current role.
benefit_to_users: Writing good government grants (and hopefully getting them!) showcases
  that we know how to successfully take a project from idea to completion.
