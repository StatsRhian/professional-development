activity_description: 
  This was a workshop on the forecasting adhesion on the rails, a key issue in the railway industry. The morning consisted of talks explaining the problem in more detail. This included an overview of operational problems (John Edgley, chair of AWG), the impact on train operators (Rob Cummings, Northern Rail), developments on the tube (Priyank Patel, TfL) and the Met Office Approach (Dr Victoria Chapman & Dan Adamson, Met Office). In the afternoon we took part in workshops to try and brainstorm potential approaches to the forecasting problem. 
benefit_to_practice: This session involved a lot of domain-specific knowledge. I left
  the event feeling like I had a much greater understanding of the rail sector and
  the many different players. The session on the MetDesk showcased a great way to
  provide domain-specific predictions in the rail sector. I learnt a great deal about
  the adhesion problem, and the RSSB funding available.
benefit_to_users: This event informed me on how we can best submit a funding call
  to forecast poor adhesion, If funded, we will be able to deliver a new product for
  our users, increasing safety and decreasing train delays during the difficult Autumn
  season.
