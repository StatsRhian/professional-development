  I was invited to present at the NW RD of the IMechE. I presented a case study on a vision system.  There were two other case studies, which were followed by the Chairman's address. The Railway Division Chair, Andy Mellors, examined the economic and wider societal benefits which the rail industry delivers and considered the current challenges facing the industry.
benefit_to_practice: |
  The chairman's address by Andy Mellors gave me an excellent insight into the challenges that working in the railway can bring. I met a PhD student who presented his research on using deep neural networks to identify bicycles. He introduced me to a couple of techniques which may be useful in our work.

  Presenting our research to members of the IMechE allowed me to to understand better the difficulties in getting our research on the trains.
