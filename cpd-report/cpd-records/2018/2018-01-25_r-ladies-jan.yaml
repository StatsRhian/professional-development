activity_description: Using a real-life data set R-Ladies Manchester is hosting a
  workshop evening that will allow members to learn, and develop, skills and tricks
  for approaching a new data analysis project. We will split into groups, preferably
  with each group having a mix of backgrounds and R experience, to give the opportunity
  of peer learning and support. We envision that the workshop will include• Using
  branches in Github to work on different versions of the project• Importing data
  into R• Data analysis and visualisations in R• Finding interesting insights from
  the data which we could present at the Manchester R group.
benefit_to_practice: 'The introduction to using branches in GitHub was very insightful.
  I also taught some data analysis techniques to other attendees. '
benefit_to_users: Using GitHub is an excellent way to ensure that our service is well
  documented, uses version control and is reproducible.
