 First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Rail Competition Briefing - York,2.0,"Do you have an innovative product and service that is ready for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?

Or are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling stock, infrastructure or stations?

If so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the first time in real-world rail environments.”

The themes for this FoaK2 competition are:

Decarbonising the railways: Decarbonisation is a priority across the network, including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies, energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies, novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.
Customer experience in stations: This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision of the ‘station of the future’.
Innovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness and integration into the railway system.

FoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.

Innovations for this competition must be:

High TRL proven technologies – i.e. market ready
Very low technology risk
The focus will be on: Integration activities; Demonstration proof of concept to customers and end-users; Collecting feedback from customers and users; Real innovations in the real world
Businesses can apply for a share of a substantial pot of money for First of a Kind technology to demonstrate aspects of tomorrow’s railway today. This competition offers the potential of 100% funding, with projects starting in early 2019.

 Lancaster Data Science Meetup,1.0,"We'll be joined by Matt Barnes who's going to talk about data science methods used to analyse air quality data. (See Matt's blog here: https://beardsandtriathlons.wordpress.com/category/air-quality/)

We're going to use Matt's work to launch our group project and build something similar for Lancaster. We plan to get our group project going using local air quality data and data from Hazelrigg weather station.

We're going to be joined by a representative from Lancaster Council and the manager of Hazelrigg weather station so that we can talk about bringing data together and creating something useful for our city.",Matt gave an excellent talk about analysing air quality data. He highlighted a number of specific challenges with collecting air quality data which had not occurred to me before. We also had an in depth chat about using API's. Since this talk I've been enthused to investigate Open APIs and see whether these can be utilised in the systems that we are developing. ,"I am currently investigating methods to integrate open source weather (particularly API systems) with our client data where required to create deeper, more improved systems."
 Lancaster Data Science Meetup,1.0,"Tassos will go through the evolution process of OpenStreetCab, a mobile service for taxi price comparison. We will begin by discussing how the release of open datasets has made the app possible and we will continue by providing data driven insights aspects of urban transport economics and routing behaviour. The talk will feature - amongst others - comical elements behind the story of OpenStreetCab, including interactions with Black Cab drivers but also Uber itself.
",It was fascinating to hear how Tassos has taken an academic project right through to a real-life app. This made me think about how important it is to have a focus when developing a new product.  There was also an excellent networking event where I met local data scientists. ,My work involves taking academic ideas and bring them right through to the Technology Readiness Level 10. Hearing Tassos's story helped me re-think the importance of including customers at all levels throughout the process.
Arctic Shores Training:  Measuring Personality,2.0,Emily Boardman delivered a training course on psychometrics and the way to measure personality traits.,"Having a good knowledge of the personality traits ensures that I can consider these whilst developing models for Arctic Shores.

It is also personally interesting to understand my own personality traits better. ","As a data scientist at Arctic Shores, I will have to develop statistical models which predict personality. Having an in-depth understanding of the traits that we are trying to model is essential to the development of the model, and therefore the service which Arctic Shores provide. "
Arctic Shores Training: DataHub,2.0,"Qasim and Richard delivered training to me on how to use the DataHub. 
This included submitting a pull request and the python style guides used. ",This detailed training session taught me how to use the Arctic Shores Data Hub to submit queries and pull data. I also learned how to submit a pull request to the Arctic Shores Bitbucket account. ,My ability to use the DataHub well directed affected to the quality of the data analysis that I can provide Arctic Shores. Being able to quickly navigate around the Data Hub and find and extract meaningful data is a huge part of my job at Arctic Shores.
Arctic Shores Training: Security,1.0,"Security training delivered by Jorn on best practice.
Included choices for passwords, two-factor authentication, public wifi and laptop encryption. ","Jorn's presentation taught me how to ensure that Arctic Shores data is kept secure. 
As part of the session, I set up two-factor authentication on my mobile and encrypted my work laptop. We also discussed accessing the DataHub over public wifi. ","Arctic Shores stores some personal data of the users. Therefore, we have a duty to follow UK guidance and best practice to keep their data secure. "
Arctic Shores: Annual Summit,2.0,"Presentations from different employees of Arctic Shores. 
Talks on:
Upgrades to the DataHub
History of Psychometrics
Combinations of traits and levels
Inspector Help
Automatic interview questions","The variety of talks from different departments of Arctic Shores made the session very interesting and beneficial for me. Working as a lone statistician in a psychology company, it's vital to connect with the other departments. The talk from the DataHub about ""Inspector Help"" highlighted functionality with the DataHub which I did not previously know about. The Psychologist provided a history of psychometrics which was fascinating and helped me understand where the development of our tests have come from. The client services team showcased a new product in development which I will be working on in the near future.
I also gave a talk on my work exploring the relationship between traits and levels which was apparently very useful.","Understanding how the company works, and what projects other departments are working on is vital to providing a great service to our clients. "
Code for Lancaster,1.0,"Code for Lancaster is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup.

We were inspired by Code for Boston, and are made up of volunteer developers, designers, data geeks, citizen activists, and many others who look to use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.

We're having our first meeting at The Borough in Lancaster on Tuesday 30 October from 5.30pm.

5.30 - 6.30 Gather, networking
6.30 - 6.45 Quick overview of the work of Digital Lancashire
6.45 - 7.15 Thomas Skarbek-Wazynski to introduce Code Brigades, Code for Boston... and what we hope to achieve with Code for Lancaster
7.15 - Discussion about what the Code Brigade / Code for Lancaster initiative, and plans for a hack on #LancashireDigitalDay, November 27th
7.45 – More networking
Join us to discuss how we can hack Lancaster to make it a better place for everyone (and make plans for our first hackathon taking place 27 November on #LancashireDigitalDay!)

For example: “How might we better enable locals to be aware of mental health support” we consider a good problem statement, but “Let’s build a phone app to show people where the bus stops are” we consider to be a poor problem statement. The reason for this is so that we do not approach a project with a bunch of assumptions. We want to research the issue and find the best way to solve that issue.  

All projects must be open-source and freely available for their entire lifetime. We host all our project code on github, and if the project doesn’t involve code we will make it openly available in some other accessible way.  Projects of a political nature have to unbiased.

Projects focused on open-data, political awareness and transparency are fair game, but projects to support a particular political viewpoint are not.","Useful networking session, mixing with full stack developers as well as data scientists and statisticians. ","A number of the topics came back to discussing the ""What services can we provide"" vs ""What services do the users actually want?"" These discussions made me re-think the services that we currently provide and encouraged me to focus on the customer. "
"Data Conversations: Keep it, throw it, put it in the vault.",1.0,"In this Data Conversation we want to talk about the long term value of data. How can we make sure that data is accessible and usable now and into the future? Should we be keeping all of our data and if not, how can we assess what has long term value?

Come and share your data stories. We’d like to hear from:

People who’ve made decisions about what’s really worth preserving for the long term.
People who’ve created data that has been reused.
People who’ve reused data.
People who’ve lost data.
People who’ve faced obstacles reusing data.
People who’ve moved institutions and struggled to access their data","The speakers discussed their experiences with data, particularly how storing data that they hadn't expected to be useful was important in their analysis. We had some interesting discussions about lost data and personal data.",One of the first steps with users is discussing what data they have or deciding what data should be collected. Discussing best practises of data storage and collection will ensure we make the most of client's data.

Reading: R4DS,4.0,"Working through the R4DS book in Autumn 2017. 
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/

 This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising and exploring data.

RSS Lancashire Talk: David Spiegelhalter,1.0,"David Spiegelhalter - Trust in Numbers

Those who value quantitative and scientific evidence are faced with claims both of a reproducibility crisis in scientific publication, and of a post-truth society abounding in fake news and alternative facts.  Both issues are of vital importance to statisticians, and both are deeply concerned with trust in expertise.  By considering the ‘pipelines’ through which scientific and political evidence is propagated, I will consider possible ways of improving both the trustworthiness of the statistical evidence being communicated, and the ability of audiences to assess the quality and reliability of what they are being told.
","David's talk presented a number of excellent examples which I can use in my role as an RSS Statistical ambassador. The pipelines that he discussed has encouraged me to take responsibility for the way that my research is communicated. I will do this by ensuring that all press releases are accompanied by more public-friendly versions, there by helping University press offices do there work. ","In my role as statistical ambassador for the RSS, David has provided me with many excellent examples which I can share when educating members of the public."
RSS Lancashire Talk: Davide Pigoli,0.5,"The statistical analysis of acoustic phonetic data: exploring differences between spoken Romance languages

Exploring phonetic changes between languages is relevant to understand their history and geographical spread. While many studies have considered differences in textual form or in phonetic transcription, it is somewhat more difficult to analyse speech recordings in this manner, although this is usually the dominant mode of transmission of language changes. Here, we propose a novel approach to explore phonetic changes, using log-spectrograms of speech recordings. After pre-processing the data to remove inherent individual differences, we identify time and frequency covariance functions as a feature of the language; in contrast, the mean depends mostly on the word that has been uttered. We use these means and covariances to postulate paths between languages, and we illustrate some preliminary results obtained when the model is applied to recordings of speakers of selected Romance languages. This is part of a joint work with P.Z. Hadjipantelis, J.S. Coleman and J.A.D. Aston.","It was interesting to learn how it is possible to analyse acoustical data using Fourier analysis. In particular, separating word differences and language difference.",Expanding the types of data that we are able to analysis broadens the services that we are able to provide

In the last few years, data science has become an increasingly popular discipline. Often linked to the use and analysis of ‘big data’, data scientists are seen as the new professionals who can unlock the potential of an increasingly data-rich world, and generate economic and social benefits from the data revolution.

However within the world of statistics, the ‘big data’ and ‘data scientist’ developments are sometimes labelled as hypes, and ‘data science’ is seen as a rebranding of what should be statistics. One of the often heard criticisms of big data analytics is that there’s a lack of statistical rigour which can lead to the wrong decisions.

As with any new discipline, there are questions about exactly what data science is. Has the relevance of statistics been diminished because of new types of data or technologies which need a radical new approach? Is data science about ‘getting the job done’, and statistics about the deeper scientific understanding? Are our universities offering students the right skill sets to meet the high demand for data scientists?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1zMUjHOLr4","I really enjoyed this discussion. Often, people ask me if I identify as a statistician or a data scientist, and what the difference is between the two. These talks helped to clarify my thoughts and provided interesting angles on the discussion. It got me thinking about the similarities and differences between the disciplines. It also encouraged me to reflect on the skills I have as someone who sits in the middle of statistics and data science.","The personal reflection helped me identify the strengths that I have due to my abilities in the intersection statistics and data science, and skills which may need development. Targetting these skills will ensure I provide a good service to users of my service."

Caroline Morris
Connecting Women in Data and Being Heard
Do you ever feel lonely at work?  Have you noticed how much time you spend being really listened to?  Do you know who to turn to for help?
I hear these and many more questions regularly in my role as a Leadership coach and it’s so refreshing to be in the coaching industry where supporting each other and being heard is a given.  However, it wasn’t always that way for me, I spent over eighteen years working in data and technology and often found myself feeling lonely and not sure where to get support.  In fact, over 50% of leaders say that they too often feel lonely.  I feel it is a real gift to make connections with people and so in my talk, I’ll be sharing the benefits of making connections, being heard and accepting help from each other.

Sue Unerman
The Glass Wall

Never mind the glass ceiling. In the workplace today there’s a glass wall. Men and women can see each other clearly through the divide, but they don’t speak the same language or have the same expectations. And as a result, women and their careers are suffering.

With more women than ever in the workforce, but still too few in the boardroom, now is the time to address the assumptions and miscommunication holding women back. My talk will explain why this is and give a sample of the strategies that women on the way up and managers need for any situation. Drawing on Unerman and Jacob’s own experience in men-dominated businesses, as well as over a hundred interviews with both men and women, The Glass Wall provides clear, smart and easy-to apply strategies for success. From unlocking ambition and developing resilience to nurturing creativity and getting noticed, these are the skills that everyone needs to learn to help break down that wall and create better workplaces for all.
