activity_description:
- Introduction for the career mentoring scheme I'm taking part in. There was a onehour
  sessionWhat Skills Does a Lancaster Career Mentor Need?by Rob Pickersgill, Real
  Life Learning, Director, Coach  TrainerThere was also networking time with other
  career mentors which I found really beneficial.
- Career Mentoring. I've been mentoring two students who are interested in becoming
  data scientists. One is an undergraduate, and one is a postgraduate. The scheme
  runs from November 2019  May 2020.

benefit_to_practice:
- Rob's session on mentoring was really helpful. He discussed techniques such as empathy
  and active listening. He also encouraged me to reflect on what I wanted to get out
  of the scheme.

benefit_to_users:
- I believe there is a strong link between mentoring and being a good consultant.
  Rob's talk, and chatting with the other mentors gave me time to reflect on my consultancy
  skills, and in particular active listening.
