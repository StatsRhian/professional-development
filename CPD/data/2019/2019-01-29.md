benefit_to_practice: As a data scientist, I frequently have to work on domain specific
  problems. In my current role, I specialise in railways, although I have no formal
  engineering or railway experience. These talks broaded my domain specific knowledge,
  this will help me work in this sector in future, and enable me to communicate with
  railway engineers.
benefit_to_users: As a digital railway data scientist, having good domain knowledge
  is key. By attending this lecture series, I demonstrate to users of my service that
  I am willing to develop my domain knowledge I can understand technical railway lectures
  and ask informative questions
