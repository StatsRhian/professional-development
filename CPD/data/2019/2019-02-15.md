activity_description: DSI Invited Talk, Friday Morning Talk Series Speaker Vicki HansonAbstract
  We are delighted to announce that ACM’s CEO Vicki Hanson will be visiting Lancaster
  and will give a short talk on ACM’s Data Science initiatives. All welcome.
benefit_to_practice: Vicki talked mostly about the challenges when setting up a Data
  Science masters programme. from the perspective of a computer scientist. This encouraged
  me to reflect on my own data science learning journey, one predominantly from the
  statistics side. It also made me consider the best way to teach these concepts when
  time is short.
benefit_to_users: Thinking about the best way to teach data science will structure
  and inform the way that I teach both statistics and programming in my training courses.
