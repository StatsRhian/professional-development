activity_description: An overview of population size estimation where linking registers
  results in incomplete covariates, with an application to mode of transport of serious
  road casualties.
benefit_to_practice: Peter's talk introduced me to a new challenge in population estimation,
  and how linking multiple resisters and using the Expectation Maximisation algorithm
  can be used to solve this. These methods are applied to hardtoreach populations.
  Applications include victims of human trafficking, the homeless, domestic violence,
  illegal immigrants etc.It was interesting to think about this problem from a modelling
  perspective.
benefit_to_users: If users of my service came to me with a population estimations
  problem for a hardtoreach population, e.g shelter estimating homelessness  I'd know
  what research to consider, and how to decide if the model was appropriate.
