activity_description: Shiny Beyond the Basics  Chris Campbell, Mango SolutionsAiden
  Peakman, National Nuclear Laboratory  'Bubble Trouble'Chris Billingham, MAGO  'Battle
  of the Bands featuring Tidytext and Tensorflow'Jane Jin, Autotrader  'How do you
  make a decision?'
benefit_to_practice: The Shiny tutorial by Chris was really useful. I thought I was
  quite knowledgeable about Shiny, but I hadn't really thought about interactivity
  before. This is a key concept in Shiny apps. This talk taught me that there is a
  lot more I could learn about shiny and really introduced the main concepts of interactivity
  to me. Jane introduced mlogit package for multinomial logistic regression mlogit.
  It was useful to find out about this package.Chris Billingham's talk gave me more
  of an insight into the capabilities of the tidytext package and also introduced
  me to the tuneR package for analysing music and speech. I also had a good networking
  session with Chris and Jonathan from MAGO afterwards. Useful discussions including
  pipelines.TLDR Gained key understanding of interactivity in Shiny, and learnt a
  little about some new R packages.
benefit_to_users: Now I have a better understanding of how Shiny apps work under the
  hood, I'll be able to build faster, better apps for my clients.
