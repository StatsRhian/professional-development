activity_description: Data science and associated fields of machine learning, machine
  vision, natural language processing and AI are seen as gamechanging technologies
  in many commercial, scientific, governmental and academic spheres. The ease, size
  and speed of data acquisition, processing, connectivity and storage, combined with
  the easy availability of sufficient computational resources, mean that methods for
  empirical inference can be applied in an everincreasing range of situations. Whereas
  the underlying inference problems are often of themselves technically rather mundane,
  the challenge lies in applying relatively wellknown algorithms for statistical learning
  (which have typically existed in some form for decades) to problems of considerably
  increased scale, and enabling deployment of at line or real time solutions.This
  talk will outline some of the areas in which the digitalisation agenda and data
  science is impacting an organisation like Shell. Areas where data science is proving
  most beneficial will be summarised, as will current difficulties. For instance,
  we will consider the critical challenge of model assurance in applied data science,
  involving the development and implementation of insitu methods for algorithm agnostic
  assessment and comparison of datadriven solutions to practical industrial problems.
