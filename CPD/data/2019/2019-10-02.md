benefit_to_practice: As a professional female programmer, I believe it's important
  to give back to the community.By running these sessions, I have to design educational
  content at a suitable level. I also have to organise the sessions, and advertise
  them.RLadies is also a great place to connect with like minded professionals and
  discuss issues and finding in the R community. It's a great networking opportunity
  for me.I also learn lots each session, this could be a new R package that I haven't
  heard of, or simply a better way to explain a problem to an attendee.
benefit_to_users: By delivering workshops to the community and supporting new learners,
  my clients can see that1) Opensource development is important to me2) I'm a skilled
  educator3) I'm a supportive listenerIt might be important to clients that I support
  STEM education programmes for women.This also demonstrates to clients that I am
  a key member in the R North West community.
