activity_description: I decided I wanted to brush up on SQL.I completed the SQL murder
  mystery
benefit_to_practice: I haven't used SQL before. I wanted to gain basic knowledge of
  the commands, so I can communicate better with clients and attendees at my R training.
benefit_to_users: Many of our clients use SQL, so having a basic understanding of
  SQL commands can help me understand their data bases.]Also, when teaching people
  how to use R, many of them know SQL, but not R. By understanding basic SQL, I can
  make comparisons between R and SQL, hopefully cementing their knowledge.This is
  particularly relevant when teaching tidyr package.
