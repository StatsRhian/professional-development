 First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Rail Competition Briefing - York,2.0,"Do you have an innovative product and service that is ready for market exploitation, but has not yet been tested in a real-world railway environment?

Or are you a railway organisation with a vision to upgrade and future proof your rolling stock, infrastructure or stations?

If so, this First of a Kind (FoaK) 2 Competition will be for you. It is being delivered to “evaluate new rail technologies for the first time in real-world rail environments.”

The themes for this FoaK2 competition are:

Decarbonising the railways: Decarbonisation is a priority across the network, including stations, rolling stock and infrastructure. Optimising energy use is a challenge that prioritises optimised on-board and lineside energy storage technologies, energy recovery systems, small-scale energy generation and harvesting technologies, novel electrification techniques and lightweight vehicle technology.
Customer experience in stations: This theme focuses on demonstrating how innovative technology can be integrated for the first time in a railway station. Within this theme, the vision of this competition is to fit a single station with a number of innovative solutions to enhance the passengers’ experience of using the station and to deliver a vision of the ‘station of the future’.
Innovate UK, on behalf of the Department for Transport (DfT), will manage this FoaK 2 competition to accelerate innovation in the UK rail sector, enabling innovative solutions to take the final step to market readiness and integration into the railway system.

FoaK 2 will break down barriers to the delivery of innovations into the rail industry, by proving that the innovation delivers the expected outcomes when integrated in a complex real-world rail application.

Innovations for this competition must be:

High TRL proven technologies – i.e. market ready
Very low technology risk
The focus will be on: Integration activities; Demonstration proof of concept to customers and end-users; Collecting feedback from customers and users; Real innovations in the real world
Businesses can apply for a share of a substantial pot of money for First of a Kind technology to demonstrate aspects of tomorrow’s railway today. This competition offers the potential of 100% funding, with projects starting in early 2019.

 Lancaster Data Science Meetup,1.0,"We'll be joined by Matt Barnes who's going to talk about data science methods used to analyse air quality data. (See Matt's blog here: https://beardsandtriathlons.wordpress.com/category/air-quality/)

We're going to use Matt's work to launch our group project and build something similar for Lancaster. We plan to get our group project going using local air quality data and data from Hazelrigg weather station.

We're going to be joined by a representative from Lancaster Council and the manager of Hazelrigg weather station so that we can talk about bringing data together and creating something useful for our city.",Matt gave an excellent talk about analysing air quality data. He highlighted a number of specific challenges with collecting air quality data which had not occurred to me before. We also had an in depth chat about using API's. Since this talk I've been enthused to investigate Open APIs and see whether these can be utilised in the systems that we are developing. ,"I am currently investigating methods to integrate open source weather (particularly API systems) with our client data where required to create deeper, more improved systems."
 Lancaster Data Science Meetup,1.0,"Tassos will go through the evolution process of OpenStreetCab, a mobile service for taxi price comparison. We will begin by discussing how the release of open datasets has made the app possible and we will continue by providing data driven insights aspects of urban transport economics and routing behaviour. The talk will feature - amongst others - comical elements behind the story of OpenStreetCab, including interactions with Black Cab drivers but also Uber itself.
",It was fascinating to hear how Tassos has taken an academic project right through to a real-life app. This made me think about how important it is to have a focus when developing a new product.  There was also an excellent networking event where I met local data scientists. ,My work involves taking academic ideas and bring them right through to the Technology Readiness Level 10. Hearing Tassos's story helped me re-think the importance of including customers at all levels throughout the process.
Arctic Shores Training:  Measuring Personality,2.0,Emily Boardman delivered a training course on psychometrics and the way to measure personality traits.,"Having a good knowledge of the personality traits ensures that I can consider these whilst developing models for Arctic Shores.

It is also personally interesting to understand my own personality traits better. ","As a data scientist at Arctic Shores, I will have to develop statistical models which predict personality. Having an in-depth understanding of the traits that we are trying to model is essential to the development of the model, and therefore the service which Arctic Shores provide. "
Arctic Shores Training: DataHub,2.0,"Qasim and Richard delivered training to me on how to use the DataHub. 
This included submitting a pull request and the python style guides used. ",This detailed training session taught me how to use the Arctic Shores Data Hub to submit queries and pull data. I also learned how to submit a pull request to the Arctic Shores Bitbucket account. ,My ability to use the DataHub well directed affected to the quality of the data analysis that I can provide Arctic Shores. Being able to quickly navigate around the Data Hub and find and extract meaningful data is a huge part of my job at Arctic Shores.

Working as a lone statistician in a psychology company, it's vital to connect with the other departments. The talk from the DataHub about ""Inspector Help"" highlighted functionality with the DataHub which I did not previously know about. The Psychologist provided a history of psychometrics which was fascinating and helped me understand where the development of our tests have come from. The client services team showcased a new product in development which I will be working on in the near future.
I also gave a talk on my work exploring the relationship between traits and levels which was apparently very useful.","Understanding how the company works, and what projects other departments are working on is vital to providing a great service to our clients. "

Challenges in practical applied data science: Philip Jonathan,0.0,"Data science and associated fields of machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing and ""AI"" are seen as ""game-changing"" technologies in many commercial, scientific, governmental and academic spheres. The ease, size and speed of data acquisition, processing, connectivity and storage, combined with the easy availability of sufficient computational resources, mean that methods for empirical inference can be applied in an ever-increasing range of situations. Whereas the underlying inference problems are often of themselves technically rather mundane, the challenge lies in applying relatively well-known algorithms for statistical learning (which have typically existed in some form for decades) to problems of considerably increased scale, and enabling deployment of ""at line"" or real time solutions.

This talk will outline some of the areas in which the ""digitalisation agenda"" and data science is impacting an organisation like Shell. Areas where data science is proving most beneficial will be summarised, as will current difficulties. For instance, we will consider the critical challenge of ""model assurance"" in applied data science, involving the development and implementation of in-situ methods for ""algorithm agnostic"" assessment and comparison of data-driven solutions to practical industrial problems.",ASDF123,ASDF123
Code for Lancaster,1.0,"Code for Lancaster is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup.

We were inspired by Code for Boston, and are made up of volunteer developers, designers, data geeks, citizen activists, and many others who look to use creative technology to solve civic and social problems.

We're having our first meeting at The Borough in Lancaster on Tuesday 30 October from 5.30pm.

5.30 - 6.30 Gather, networking
6.30 - 6.45 Quick overview of the work of Digital Lancashire

7.15 - Discussion about what the Code Brigade / Code for Lancaster initiative, and plans for a hack on #LancashireDigitalDay, November 27th
7.45 – More networking
Join us to discuss how we can hack Lancaster to make it a better place for everyone (and make plans for our first hackathon taking place 27 November on #LancashireDigitalDay!)

For example: “How might we better enable locals to be aware of mental health support” we consider a good problem statement, but “Let’s build a phone app to show people where the bus stops are” we consider to be a poor problem statement. The reason for this is so that we do not approach a project with a bunch of assumptions. We want to research the issue and find the best way to solve that issue.  

All projects must be open-source and freely available for their entire lifetime. We host all our project code on github, and if the project doesn’t involve code we will make it openly available in some other accessible way.  Projects of a political nature have to unbiased.

Projects focused on open-data, political awareness and transparency are fair game, but projects to support a particular political viewpoint are not.","Useful networking session, mixing with full stack developers as well as data scientists and statisticians. ","A number of the topics came back to discussing the ""What services can we provide"" vs ""What services do the users actually want?"" These discussions made me re-think the services that we currently provide and encouraged me to focus on the customer. "

Predicting the future repayment patterns of portfolios of non-performing debt using advanced statistical modelling.

Debt is a prominent and open concern in society and the wider economy.  Individuals who have defaulted on their debt expect to be treated fairly during the collection process.  Arrow Global is a debt purchaser and debt management company.  It purchases portfolios of non-performing consumer debt in bulk from banks and other financial institutions at a reduced cost compared to their face value.  It then takes over the responsibility of collecting the debt.  What distinguishes Arrow from other debt management companies is its approach to treating customers fairly by taking into account the individual circumstances of each customer and then tailoring a payment plan which the customer can afford.  For example, customers are able to spread repayments over long periods of time, with many customers only paying £1 per month.  Arrow Global is also the only UK based debt management company to have approval from the Financial Conduct Authority.
For decision making purposes, Arrow Global uses a stochastic statistical model to simulate the payment behaviour of each of its 6 million customers for 7 years into the future.  Due to the stochastic nature of the model, it must be run numerous times to minimise the Monte Carlo error.  Currently, the computational resources allow it to be run only five times per account, which is insufficient.  In collaboration with the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, Arrow is investigating novel statistical methods for carrying out up to 100+ model runs per account but with the same computing resources.  In this talk I will present current results that implement these methods and I will describe other methods that we believe will improve the performance, accuracy and utility of the model.

Speaker: Vicki Hanson
Abstract: We are delighted to announce that ACM’s CEO Vicki Hanson will be visiting Lancaster and will give a short talk on ACM’s Data Science initiatives. All welcome.","Vicki talked mostly about the challenges when setting up a Data Science masters programme. from the perspective of a computer scientist. This encouraged me to reflect on my own data science learning journey, one pre-dominantly from the statistics side. It also made me consider the best way to teach these concepts when time is short.",Thinking about the best way to teach data science will structure and inform the way that I teach both statistics and programming in my training courses.
DSI talk: Quantifying Input Modelling error in Simulation models – what is it and why does it matter?,0.5,"Lucy Morgan, a new lecturer in the Management School, gave a very interesting talk on simulation models. Lucy discussed how assessing inputs into a simulation model is an area often overlooked, both in terms of the uncertainty and biases that inputs have on model outputs. Lucy showed how these effects can be properly quantified and interpreted.","Input error is an important but often neglected area of simulation modelling. 
Learning about what input error is and how I can best model it will be key to any future simulation modelling that I perform.","Any clients requiring simulation modelling will be reassured that I have thought about the possibility of input error, and have taken steps to quantify their effects on the model output.

Chris Billingham's talk gave me more of an insight into the capabilities of the tidytext package and also introduced me to the tuneR package for analysing music and speech. I also had a good networking session with Chris and Jonathan from MAG-O afterwards. Useful discussions including pipelines.

TLDR: Gained key understanding of interactivity in Shiny, and learnt a little about some new R packages.","Now I have a better understanding of how Shiny apps work under the hood, I'll be able to build faster, better apps for my clients."

","I have a tendancy to try and be good at everything rather than specialising in specific skills. Looking at my radar has reminded me of the skills which are less important in the roles that I do. I think I should focus on maintaining my Modelling, Programming and Communication skills rather than trying to keep on top of all the new different technologies (Docker, Hadoop etc.)","On an enterprise level, the Data Science Radar can help team leaders in the following ways:
To help shape a bespoke data science training course for your team by objectively identifying the training requirements of your existing staff.
To monitor learning during a long-term data science training programme.
As a visual aid to support your data scientist recruitment requirements, and to highlight where there are gaps in the skill set of your existing team and to identify the skill sets of potential new recruits.

Nic Crane (Elucidata): 10 Steps to Becoming a Tidyverse Contributor
In 2018 I became a contributor to the tidyverse and realised that you don't have to be an R expert to get involved. In this talk, I will discuss why I was originally hesitant to contribute to open source, but how the R community made me realise my doubts were unfounded. I'll walk you through the stages of making a pull request to a tidyverse package and discuss my experiences of doing so. Whilst the focus of this talk is on contributing code, I conclude with the other valuable ways you can get involved, whether you've been using R for 2 weeks or 20 years. I'd love to make this talk interactive, so please bring any questions you have!

Rhian Davies (Jumping Rivers): A day in the life with R.

RSS Lancashire Talk: David Spiegelhalter,1.0,"David Spiegelhalter - Trust in Numbers

Those who value quantitative and scientific evidence are faced with claims both of a reproducibility crisis in scientific publication, and of a post-truth society abounding in fake news and alternative facts.  Both issues are of vital importance to statisticians, and both are deeply concerned with trust in expertise.  By considering the ‘pipelines’ through which scientific and political evidence is propagated, I will consider possible ways of improving both the trustworthiness of the statistical evidence being communicated, and the ability of audiences to assess the quality and reliability of what they are being told.
","David's talk presented a number of excellent examples which I can use in my role as an RSS Statistical ambassador. The pipelines that he discussed has encouraged me to take responsibility for the way that my research is communicated. I will do this by ensuring that all press releases are accompanied by more public-friendly versions, there by helping University press offices do there work. ","In my role as statistical ambassador for the RSS, David has provided me with many excellent examples which I can share when educating members of the public."
RSS Lancashire Talk: Davide Pigoli,0.5,"The statistical analysis of acoustic phonetic data: exploring differences between spoken Romance languages

Exploring phonetic changes between languages is relevant to understand their history and geographical spread. While many studies have considered differences in textual form or in phonetic transcription, it is somewhat more difficult to analyse speech recordings in this manner, although this is usually the dominant mode of transmission of language changes. Here, we propose a novel approach to explore phonetic changes, using log-spectrograms of speech recordings. After pre-processing the data to remove inherent individual differences, we identify time and frequency covariance functions as a feature of the language; in contrast, the mean depends mostly on the word that has been uttered. We use these means and covariances to postulate paths between languages, and we illustrate some preliminary results obtained when the model is applied to recordings of speakers of selected Romance languages. This is part of a joint work with P.Z. Hadjipantelis, J.S. Coleman and J.A.D. Aston.","It was interesting to learn how it is possible to analyse acoustical data using Fourier analysis.

In the last few years, data science has become an increasingly popular discipline. Often linked to the use and analysis of ‘big data’, data scientists are seen as the new professionals who can unlock the potential of an increasingly data-rich world, and generate economic and social benefits from the data revolution.

However within the world of statistics, the ‘big data’ and ‘data scientist’ developments are sometimes labelled as hypes, and ‘data science’ is seen as a rebranding of what should be statistics. One of the often heard criticisms of big data analytics is that there’s a lack of statistical rigour which can lead to the wrong decisions.

As with any new discipline, there are questions about exactly what data science is. Has the relevance of statistics been diminished because of new types of data or technologies which need a radical new approach? Is data science about ‘getting the job done’, and statistics about the deeper scientific understanding? Are our universities offering students the right skill sets to meet the high demand for data scientists?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1zMUjHOLr4","I really enjoyed this discussion. Often, people ask me if I identify as a statistician or a data scientist, and what the difference is between the two. These talks helped to clarify my thoughts and provided interesting angles on the discussion. It got me thinking about the similarities and differences between the disciplines. It also encouraged me to reflect on the skills I have as someone who sits in the middle of statistics and data science.","The personal reflection helped me identify the strengths that I have due to my abilities in the intersection statistics and data science, and skills which may need development. Targetting these skills will ensure I provide a good service to users of my service."

Connecting Women in Data and Being Heard
Do you ever feel lonely at work?  Have you noticed how much time you spend being really listened to?  Do you know who to turn to for help?
I hear these and many more questions regularly in my role as a Leadership coach and it’s so refreshing to be in the coaching industry where supporting each other and being heard is a given.  However, it wasn’t always that way for me, I spent over eighteen years working in data and technology and often found myself feeling lonely and not sure where to get support.  In fact, over 50% of leaders say that they too often feel lonely.  I feel it is a real gift to make connections with people and so in my talk, I’ll be sharing the benefits of making connections, being heard and accepting help from each other.

The Glass Wall

Never mind the glass ceiling. In the workplace today there’s a glass wall. Men and women can see each other clearly through the divide, but they don’t speak the same language or have the same expectations. And as a result, women and their careers are suffering.

With more women than ever in the workforce, but still too few in the boardroom, now is the time to address the assumptions and miscommunication holding women back. My talk will explain why this is and give a sample of the strategies that women on the way up and managers need for any situation. Drawing on Unerman and Jacob’s own experience in men-dominated businesses, as well as over a hundred interviews with both men and women, The Glass Wall provides clear, smart and easy-to apply strategies for success. From unlocking ambition and developing resilience to nurturing creativity and getting noticed, these are the skills that everyone needs to learn to help break down that wall and create better workplaces for all.
