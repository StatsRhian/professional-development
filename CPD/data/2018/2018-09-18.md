activity_description: In this Data Conversation we want to talk about the long term
  value of data. How can we make sure that data is accessible and usable now and into
  the future? Should we be keeping all of our data and if not, how can we assess what
  has long term value?Come and share your data stories. We’d like to hear fromPeople

benefit_to_practice: The speakers discussed their experiences with data, particularly
  how storing data that they hadn't expected to be useful was important in their analysis.
  We had some interesting discussions about lost data and personal data.
benefit_to_users: One of the first steps with users is discussing what data they have
  or deciding what data should be collected. Discussing best practises of data storage
  and collection will ensure we make the most of client's data.
