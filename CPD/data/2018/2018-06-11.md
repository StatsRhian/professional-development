benefit_to_practice: This session involved a lot of domainspecific knowledge. I left
  the event feeling like I had a much greater understanding of the rail sector and
  the many different players. The session on the MetDesk showcased a great way to
  provide domainspecific predictions in the rail sector. I learnt a great deal about
  the adhesion problem, and the RSSB funding available.
benefit_to_users: This event informed me on how we can best submit a funding call
  to forecast poor adhesion, If funded, we will be able to deliver a new product for
  our users, increasing safety and decreasing train delays during the difficult Autumn
  season.
