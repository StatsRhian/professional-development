activity_description: '@DreamAgility using ML for image recognition to improve product
  descriptions in Google shopping searchMartin from @boohoo on Deep Feature SynthesisErik
  from@Octavia Bants about GANS'
benefit_to_practice: Martin gave an overview of Max Kanter and Kalyan Veeramachaneni's
  paper on  Deep Feature Synthesis.  This is a new technique which I am keen to try
  out on our data. Erik gave a great introduction to GANS (Generative adversarial
  networks). This again was a new technique which I was hoping to learn more about.
  Erik's talk gave a good overview of the pros, cons, and when these techniques are
  appropriate.The Dream agility talk gave a great end to end story of how A/B testing
  can work. All three talks introduced new techniques which I am keen to introduce
  into our work.
benefit_to_users: Automatic feature extraction will allow us to generate better quality
  and more creative features. This will allow us to extract more information from
  client data.
