activity_description: Book club Data Imports & TibblesWe're starting a new bookclub
  series where we will work through some chapters from the wonderful R for Data Science
  (http//r4ds.had.co.nz/). In this first session we will cover topics on Importing
  Data and working with Tibbles (chapters 7 & 8).If you are completely new to R and
  would like a hand setting up R on your laptop come chat to us at the beginning of
  the session and we can help you out.We hope these sessions will be a great introduction
  and development sessions for those of you who are new to R.For those more experienced
  R users we will look to provide some challenges related to the topics or you can
  help mentor others.Many thanks to Peak for offering us a space to use for this event.
  If you can offer us a space for future events please get in touch.
benefit_to_practice: This bookclub included an excellent comparison of data.frames()
  and tibbles().These extra tips will help improve my R coding.
benefit_to_users: Staying uptodate with R coding practice is essential to good development.
