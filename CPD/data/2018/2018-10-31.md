  – The curse of the unspecified data definitionUsing R in a business environment
benefit_to_practice: This was a hugely beneficial day for me. The talks covered a
  broad rang e of topics and techniques from interactive teaching with the R language,
  to reproducible data analysis. I have plenty of great resources to take away and
  work through.
benefit_to_users: In particular the training session with Chris Campbell on the Curse
  of unspecified data definition  taught me the importance of clearly defined data
  rules when dealing with client data. By implementing the principles and techniques
  that I learnt in the workshop, we will be able to provide a more robust data service
  for our clients.
