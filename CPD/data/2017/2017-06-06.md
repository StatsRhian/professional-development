activity_description: We'll be joined by Matt Barnes who's going to talk about data
  science methods used to analyse air quality data. (See Matt's blog here https//beardsandtriathlons.wordpress.com/category/airquality/)We're
  going to use Matt's work to launch our group project and build something similar
  for Lancaster. We plan to get our group project going using local air quality data
  and data from Hazelrigg weather station.We're going to be joined by a representative
  from Lancaster Council and the manager of Hazelrigg weather station so that we can
  talk about bringing data together and creating something useful for our city.
benefit_to_practice: Matt gave an excellent talk about analysing air quality data.
  He highlighted a number of specific challenges with collecting air quality data
  which had not occurred to me before. We also had an in depth chat about using API's.
  Since this talk I've been enthused to investigate Open APIs and see whether these
  can be utilised in the systems that we are developing.
benefit_to_users: I am currently investigating methods to integrate open source weather
  (particularly API systems) with our client data where required to create deeper,
  more improved systems.
