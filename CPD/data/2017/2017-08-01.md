benefit_to_practice: Although I use shiny reguarly, and am aware of the important
  of testing code  I had not heard of shiny test. Chris introduced the R package shiny
  test and demonstrated how easily tests can be implemented into shiny apps.
benefit_to_users: Learning about shiny test has inspired me to include testing in
  all shiny apps that I develop. This should help flag up any bugs quickly, creating
  a more dependable service for our users.
