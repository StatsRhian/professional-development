activity_description: https//style.tidyverse.org/I worked through the style book and
  made notes to develop my own personal style guide for writing R code. Good coding
  style is like correct punctuation you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread.
  This site describes the style used throughout the tidyverse. It was originally derived
  from Googleâ€™s R style guide, but has evolved and expanded considerably over the
  years.
benefit_to_practice: Forcing myself to abide by my own style guide ensures that I
  am constantly good standard code. It also makes it easier for other data scientists
  to read my code and provide feedback. I intend to create a Digital Rail code guide.
benefit_to_users: Having a clear style guide makes better code and, therefore, better
  analysis.
