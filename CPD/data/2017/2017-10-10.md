activity_description: Work summit in London, introducing me to the company, how our
  department works and reviewing our plans for writing papers in 2018.
benefit_to_practice: This session was invaluable to introduce me to the science department
  of Arctic Shores. I learnt about how the department operates, what their outputs
  are and who does what. We discussed which journals and conferences are key in psychology,
  and the role of the British Psychological Society.
benefit_to_users: Having a good understanding of how my department works is essential
  to quickly providing good quality analysis for our clients. Targetting the correct
  conferences with papers provides our clients with confidence that our tools have
  a strong scientific basis.
