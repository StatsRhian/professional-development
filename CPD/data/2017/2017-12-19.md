activity_description: Training material delivered by Assessment Day.Covered how to
  develop numerical aptitude tests, including the writing of questions and assessing
  the difficulty.
benefit_to_practice: Over the next couple of months, it is my job to develop an aptitude
  assessment from scratch. As I do not have any formal psychometrics training, it
  was essential to seek training from experts. I've developed a good understanding
  of how to develop these tests, from writing good questions to analysing the difficulty.
benefit_to_users: Being trained in aptitude tests, allows me to write a good quality
  assessment. Having an accurate assessment will allow our clients to ensure that
  they employ the best possible candidates with confidence.
