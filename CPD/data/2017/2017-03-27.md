activity_description: Tassos will go through the evolution process of OpenStreetCab,
  a mobile service for taxi price comparison. We will begin by discussing how the
  release of open datasets has made the app possible and we will continue by providing
  data driven insights aspects of urban transport economics and routing behaviour.
  The talk will feature  amongst others  comical elements behind the story of OpenStreetCab,
  including interactions with Black Cab drivers but also Uber itself.
benefit_to_practice: It was fascinating to hear how Tassos has taken an academic project
  right through to a reallife app. This made me think about how important it is to
  have a focus when developing a new product.  There was also an excellent networking
  event where I met local data scientists.
benefit_to_users: My work involves taking academic ideas and bring them right through
  to the Technology Readiness Level 10. Hearing Tassos's story helped me rethink the
  importance of including customers at all levels throughout the process.
