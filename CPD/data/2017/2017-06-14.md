activity_description: I worked through the excellent tutorial by Karl Broman on Reproducible
  Research.https//kbroman.org/steps2rr/
benefit_to_practice: I aim to use a workflow which meets the gold standard for reproducibility.
  This guide gave me some great tips and ideas.
benefit_to_users: By providing a reproducible workflow, it increases the reliability
  of the results provided. Also, if the data changes it allows a quick reanalysis.
