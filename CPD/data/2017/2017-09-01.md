activity_description: Working through the R4DS book in Autumn 2017. https//r4ds.had.co.nz/
  This book will teach you how to do data science with R You’ll learn how to get your
  data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and
  model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just
  as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to
  clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that
  allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing
  each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate
  programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage
  cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising and exploring
  data.
benefit_to_practice: This book is the gold standard for data science in R. Working
  through the book taught me new skills, particularly in visualising data using ggplot.
benefit_to_users: Having strong R skills are essential for both analysing client data,
  but also visualising their data in a clear, intuitive way.
