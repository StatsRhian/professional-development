activity_description: https//web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdfWorking through
  the following chapters3 Linear Methods for Regression14 Unsupervised Learning15
  Random Forests
benefit_to_practice: As a statistician, it is important to understand the mathematics
  behind techniques such as linear regression, unsupervised learning and random forests.
  I focussed on these chapters are they are the most important to my current work
  with Arctic Shores, however, I would like to work through the entire book at some
  point.
benefit_to_users: Having a good understanding of these modelling techniques allows
  me to develop models for clients whilst being aware of possible pitfalls and biases.
