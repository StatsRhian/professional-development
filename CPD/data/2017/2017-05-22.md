activity_description: Emily Boardman delivered a training course on psychometrics
  and the way to measure personality traits.
benefit_to_practice: Having a good knowledge of the personality traits ensures that
  I can consider these whilst developing models for Arctic Shores.It is also personally
  interesting to understand my own personality traits better.
benefit_to_users: As a data scientist at Arctic Shores, I will have to develop statistical
  models which predict personality. Having an indepth understanding of the traits
  that we are trying to model is essential to the development of the model, and therefore
  the service which Arctic Shores provide.
